            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE To the READER.</head>
            <p>WE ſay, all is not Gold that Gliſters, and that <hi>Moſt worth</hi> lyes not ever hid under a fair <hi>Outſide.</hi> A Comet ſeems ſometimes as glorious as a Star; a Parelion like the Sun; and Falſhood got un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a handſome Viſard well trim'd up, may take with many and paſs Diſguiſed for current Truth: But ſuch ſlight Beauty beguiles not long. True Worth undoes it. The Suns laſting Glory, the Stars conſtant Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, enough Diſluſtres both Parelion and Comet: And <hi>Truth,</hi> though perhaps it may not here quite vanquiſh Falſhood (for Some will Defend it to the Worlds end) is able at leaſt to pull of it's Gaudy Viſard, and put it out of Countenance.</p>
            <p>A World of this Counterfeit Luſtre, we have now a days in Books, ſet forth (as is pretended) to Beautifie the Heaven of Chriſtianity, and Englighten <hi>a People that ſit in Darkneſs.</hi> One I have met with ('tis the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive from Popery) that Parelion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like in a Triple Cloud is (as I am told) Gloriouſly out in three Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb facs="tcp:107258:3"/> and lately appeared in the two Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> More I believe have been Gazing on it then well diſcovered the faulty Luſtre: Real Worth I cannot mention; for what find we I beſeech you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in this Book, but a uſeleſs <hi>Repetition</hi> of old de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated Objections? which have now for a whole Age run through a few Vulgar worn-out Controverſies, and in Rigor require only a <hi>Return</hi> of the Old Anſwers gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a hundred times by Catholick Writers: new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which one might have expected from ſo Great a Doctor, ſeldom appear. You have moreover, more then a few Miſtakes relating to Catholick Doctrine: Want enough of Divinity: A ſeeming Zeal, ('tis true) but ill ſeaſon'd with Jeers and harſher Language: Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies vented: <hi>Talk</hi> and no Proof. Here is, what I think, the Doctor muſt own, the Inſide and beſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Diſſwaſive.</p>
            <p>The Flaſh therefore and fair Luſtre of his Book lies neither in the choice of Matter, nor manner of handling it; but in ſpecious <hi>Quotations</hi> that flouriſh in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. Theſe ſet down in the enſuing Treatiſe, I have carefully examined; Read with my own Eyes in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Authors; (not one have I taken on truſt) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a diligent ſearch muſt profeſs with all Candor; not one (worth notice) have I found, but 'tis either whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impertinent to what he would Prove; or ſtrangely wreſted to a ſiniſter Sence; or not found at all in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal (nor a Word like it:) Or finally, (which is moſt uſual and to be pittied in a Doctor) unpardonably cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. To inſiſt on every leſs valuable Authority, or on ſuch as ſhew themſelves <hi>Profleſs</hi> even Read in the Diſſwaſive, would be Time miſpent, and weary a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Theſe I offer to your View, are of the groſſer Sort; and Numerous enough to <hi>Evidence</hi> that the Doctors
<pb facs="tcp:107258:3"/> pretended <hi>Faultleſs Book</hi> is Proved Faulty; and no more powerful to Diſſwade from Popery, then Error is to draw men from Truth.</p>
            <p>Far am I off from the Doctors Humour, in Judging this ſmall Treatiſe Faultleſs. I willingly acknowledge many Faults, but know not how to mend Them. One is, no little want of Engliſh; but this I hope dear Reader you will eaſily Pardon; I am ſure you would, did you but know how long I have been a Stranger to my Country. An other is, too tedious a length ſometimes in Latin Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences: The Fault (if any) is unavoydable: For while the Charge is laid on ill Quotations, the Right ones muſt appear, and in their proper Terms. To give an Authors Meaning only, and Wave his Words ſeems <hi>Forceleſs:</hi> And in ſtead of laying Difficulties may Raiſe up more. Where it moſt Imports I have done my beſt to Engliſh the Latin faithfully, <hi>Ad pedem literae:</hi> the Tranſlation therefore cannot but look Rugged; yet that is better, then to have the Genuine Sence miſcarry in ſmoother Language. Laſtly, a harſher Word may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, through haſt or unawares, have caſually fallen from me; if ſo, I here unſay it, and Humbly crave Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: And were my Papers (now out of my reach) in my Hands again, I would in this Correct whatever might juſtly ſeem offenſive.</p>
            <p>If Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> ſhall pleaſe to warn me of greater Faults, I'll thank him for his Charity: And if he thinks it worth his Pains to take notice of my Exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Book, my earneſt Requeſt is, that he miſpend not Time in Trifles, nor weigh only leſſer Matters, while he hath greater charged on him that juſtly require Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. For Example: I have plainly tax'd him of wrong done to <hi>Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> to the <hi>Expurgatory Index,</hi> to <hi>Petrus Lombardus, Otho Eriſingenſis,</hi> and others in the
<pb facs="tcp:107258:4"/> beginning of my Treatiſe; let him as plainly Purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in theſe Particulars, and ſhew me my Error: for moſt certainly I have either wronged him, or he theſe Authors. I preſs him afterward with undeniable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of moſt Ancient Fathers, both for the Uſe and Worſhip of Holy Images. His expreſs Anſwer is herein required alſo, chiefly to St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn Damaſcen.</hi> I have told him of his Forging ſtrange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and <hi>Fathering</hi> them on <hi>Tolet, Suarez, Bellarmin, Emanuel Sa,</hi> and others: If he be injured he can Right himſelf, and ſhew where <hi>Sa</hi> affirms, <hi>That if a man lies with his intended Wife before Marriage it is no ſin, or a light one.</hi> Whether the true Sence of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his Quotation, pag. 167. be not wholly perverted, <hi>If the Pope ſhould Err by Commanding,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe for an Eſſay only; more you will have, and of greater Concernment hereafter. May it pleaſe the Doctor to clear himſelf by a ſolid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he'll hearten me to Reply: Or if he can produce againſt me but one Quotation ſo fowly amiſs as <hi>that one</hi> Charg'd on <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> (to ſay nothing of many worſe) I do here profeſs a Readineſs, and will comply with it, to publiſh my Fault to the Whole World. O, would he Encourage himſelf to proceed with like Candor! and unſay only what his own Conſcience knows Faulty in his <hi>Diſſwaſive,</hi> he might be Eternally Glorious. And why ſhould I forbid my ſelf to hope for ſo Laudable a Retractation? Juſtice requires it: Conſcience forcibly preſſes: Truth, that ſuffers, ſtrongly Pleads for it: Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Humility eaſily ſubmits: And Gods Victorious Grace is now no leſs Powerful to do this Work on him, then once it was to Reclaim a Bleſſed St. <hi>Auſtin. Quare Arripe obſecro te</hi> (they are the Pious and well meant Words of this Saint, <hi>Tom. 2. Epiſt.</hi> 9. to a Great Doctor, and my Submiſſive Petition to Doctor <hi>Taylor.) Arripe
<pb facs="tcp:107258:4"/> obſecro te; ingenuan, &amp; vere Chriſtianam cum charitate ſeveritatem ad illud</hi> (tuum) <hi>opus corrigendum, atque eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandum &amp; <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Doctor I confeſs hath been moſt Unluckily in broaching Hereſies, and wanting Grace to retract them. Some years are now paſt ſince he was ſo Unfortunate as to become a Patron of the Pelagian Hereſie; when <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> he Writ a Book againſt Original ſin, and ſtoutly defended it: and being Friendly told by his own Brethren, that what he ſaid was not only oppoſite to Catholick Faith, but alſo to the very Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> expreſly deliver'd in her Liturgy, in 39. Articles, in the Office of Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He had yet the boldneſs to deny all, and aſſert that the Church of <hi>England</hi> held not Original Sin, though both Prince and Prelate knew then and believ'd the contrary. I know not that he ever yet Recanted this Hereſie; if not, 'tis now high Time to do it: and with it, to Weep for the Errors in his <hi>Diſſwaſive:</hi> if he fails in both Duties, the World will ſay (and ſay truly) that Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> is <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior peccans quam paenitens;</hi> more known for his Sin then for his Repentance; and may Prudently Judge that he of all others was the unfitteſt Man to Write againſt Popery that diſowns the Doctrine of his own Church: unleſs this makes him fit; that being a Pelagian, his Words
<pb facs="tcp:107258:5"/> (though he multiplies Volums) will want weight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Catholicks: For this is my reflection (and I think a true one) that this man who dar'd to ſay that the Church of <hi>England</hi> holds not Original Sin, ſo plainly taught and believ'd by all; will not Boggle to miſcite the Fathers, remote from our knowledge, Read by few, and Underſtood by fewer.</p>
            <p>Farewel Gentle Reader, with a thouſand well-wiſhes for thy profitting by this Treatiſe; I beſtow as many on Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> whoſe Enemy (God knows) I am not: Nor can he think me one, for laying out his Errors, and telling Truth: Upon this very Account he ought (and I hope will) to return me Thanks. If now I Merit none, I may hereafter have better Luck and deſerve them. If plain dealing may do it, he ſhall have Reaſon to account me, as indeed I am, his Faithful True SERVANT, and Friendly ADVERSARY.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107258:6"/> that doth manifeſt to me both the Maker, and things made; As who ſhould ſay, in this particular the Scripture is compleat, and I adore its fulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now theſe laſt words, <hi>Qua mihi &amp; factorem,</hi> &amp;c. which explain the Fathers ſence, our Dr. wholly omits, and beguiles his Reader with theſe perverted particles, <hi>if it be not written: Tertullian,</hi> after thoſe words [<hi>In Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelio vero amplius</hi>] goes on, <hi>An autem de aliqua ſubiacenti materia facta ſint omnia nuſquam adhuc legi:</hi> Whether all theſe things be made of a ſubjacent matter, I never yet read: <hi>Scriptum eſſe doceat Hermogenis officina;</hi> Let <hi>Hermogenes</hi> his Work-houſe ſhew us that this particular is written. <hi>Si non eſt Scriptum, timeat vae illud adjicientibus, aut detrahentibus destinatum;</hi> If this thing now in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie concerning the prejacent matter <hi>Hermogenes</hi> aſſerts, be not written; let him juſtly fear that Wo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd to them that detract from Scripture, or add to it. Here is exactly the whole context of <hi>Tertullian;</hi> and it renders this ſence; <hi>Hermogenes</hi> holds the world made of a ſtrange unknown matter: The Scripture directly tells us how it was made and <hi>Created</hi> of nothing. I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the fulneſs of Scripture in this particular; let therefore <hi>Hermogenes</hi> (when the Scripture hath clearly ſaid all that belongs to the firſt Creation of things) prove by Scripture that unknown matter he defends; if he cannot, he may well fear that Wo threatned to ſuch as detract from Scripture, or add to it a prejacent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter never mentioned in it. Judge good Reader whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Quotation have ſo much as a likelyhood of gain-ſaying any conſtant received Tradition in the Church. The Dr. may reply, as <hi>Hermogenes</hi> added to Scripture his unknown matter, ſo we add our unknown Traditions: I anſwer firſt, what <hi>Hermogenes</hi> defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was not only an addition, but expreſly contrary
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107258:6"/> to Holy Scripture, declaring that God made the VVorld of Nothing: No Catholick Tradition is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly or poſitively oppoſite to Gods written VVord (unknown tradition we own not) 2. <hi>Hermogenes</hi> had no ſuch approved conſent for his foolery, as we have for our Catholick, and ever received Tradition; juſtly therefore did <hi>Tertullian</hi> oppugn him by the Authority of Scripture only; for deſtitute he was of all warranted Tradition: 3. The Doctrine of our Tradition (not a pretended one, or any ſuperaddition of new Articles, as the Dr. imputes to us) is expreſly allow'd of by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf; the place is known 2 <hi>Theſſa.</hi> 2. 14. and enervates what ever hath the colour of an objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
            <p>He cites next St. <hi>Baſil de vera fide,</hi> whoſe words are theſe <hi>Paris</hi> Print 1618. <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. page 251. <hi>Haud dubie manifeſtiſſimum hoc infidelitatis argumentum fuerit, &amp; ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſuperbiae certiſſimum, ſi quis eorum quae Scripta ſunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquid velit rejicere, aut eorum quae non Scripta introducere:</hi> VVithout doubt this is a moſt manifeſt Argument of infidelity, if one will reject any one of thoſe things which are written (theſe words our Dr. omits, to make the Quotation ſound to his ſence) or, of thoſe things which are not written, introduce; to wit, into Scripture; and ſo the St. explicates himſelf clearly in theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words—<hi>Vehementiſſime interdicat ne quid corum quae in Divinis literis habeantur, dematur, aut quod abſit, addatur:</hi> VVhich is in plain Engliſh to ſay, Add we muſt not, nor diminiſh any thing in Scripture. No Catholick pretends to make that Scripture, which is not Scripture: Nor to diminiſh ſo much as one jot in that ſacred Book: You ſee therefore, ſo <hi>forceleſs</hi> this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is to gain-ſay received Tradition, that it doth not ſo much as touch upon the very Queſtion: As proofleſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107258:7"/> alſo are thoſe other two Quotations in the Doctors Margent out of St. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Morals; for <hi>regula 72. C.</hi> 1. in the ſame Edition, page 372. He only ſpeak's as the Apoſtle doth; <hi>Though an Angel Preach another Goſpel then what is Preached, let him be Anathematized,</hi> and <hi>reg. 80. cap.</hi> 22. pag. 386. he ſaith no more, but that we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the true force of thoſe things that are in Scripture; reject nothing, or make any thing new, <hi>extra divinam Scripturam;</hi> that is, as I interpret, without the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty of Scripture: but the Scripture indubitably war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants the declarations of Councils (witneſs the <hi>Nicen</hi> definitions) and conſtant received Tradition of the Church. Therefore this Authority alſo is wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to the Doctors purpoſe.</p>
            <p>VVho next, to oppoſe Tradition, cites <hi>Theoph. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exandrinus</hi> in Engliſh, thus; <hi>It is the part of a devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſpirit to think any thing to be divine, that is not in the Authority of Holy Scripture.</hi> I Anſwer, here are three faults in this one Quotation: Firſt, The words are not faithfully cited; Secondly, They are weighed outof their circumſtances, and wreſted contrary to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors meaning; Thirdly, VVere they as the Doctor would have them, they prove nothing againſt Tradition. Briefly, all know how ſharp an Adverſary <hi>Theop. Alex.</hi> was to <hi>Origen</hi> and his followers; He writ expreſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his errors, but that work is not extant; and in his 2. Epiſt. <hi>paſchali</hi> cited by the Doctor (you have it <hi>Tom. 4. Biblioth. Patrum, Cullen</hi> Print 1618. pag. 716.) after he had checked <hi>Origen</hi> for his raſhneſs, for broaching Fopperies of his own head, and arrogantly making himſelf his own Maſter, contrary to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Humility who conferred the Goſpel with other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: He ſpeaks thus of <hi>Origen</hi> ſolely; <hi>Sed ignorans quod Daemoniaci ſpiritus eſſet inſtinctus ſophiſmata huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107258:7"/> mentium ſequi, &amp; aliquid extra Scripturarum authoritatem putare Divinum:</hi> But not knowing that it is an inſtinct of a Devilliſh ſpirit to follow the ſophiſtry or deceit of mans VVit (theſe words which fully expreſs the Authors ſence our Doctor totally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit's) or to think any thing divine, not authorized, or without the Authority of Holy Scripture: So <hi>Theophilus;</hi> who, as you ſee, wholly here relates to <hi>Origen</hi>'s private errors, condemns his Pride, oppoſeth his ſophiſtry and boldneſs, in making himſelf a maſter of new Fancies, but toucheth not the leaſt on Catholick Doctrine, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwritten Tradition: and though the Doctor draws him to ſuch a ſence; it is ſoon anſwer'd, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Tradition, ſo expreſly approved by Scripture, cannot be thought a Doctrine <hi>extra Scripturae authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,</hi> without warrant of Gods Word. Now if he tells us that he oppoſeth not any ancient Tradition, but our pretended <hi>one</hi> only that found's <hi>New Articles, New Propoſitions,</hi> &amp;c. I Anſwer, He meerly combates with ſhadows; we neither own ſuch a Tradition, nor can the Doctor prove it: He ſhould have firſt named <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> of theſe New Articles, and then aſſaulted us with the Authority of Fathers directly oppoſite to our Doctrine, and not winck and fight, as he doth againſt no man knows what. If he ſays again, that he impugns all Tradition in general, all Doctrine not expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in Scripture; forced he is, not only to throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Scripture it ſelf, and the <hi>Nicen</hi> definitions: not only to diſclaim a Trinity of Perſons in one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence, Baptizing Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tenet of Proteſtant Religion (as Proteſtaniſm) <hi>E. G.</hi> the belief of two Sacraments <hi>only,</hi> which is not at all contain'd in Scripture, nor can it be drawn from Scripture by any probable diſcourſe or gloſs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107258:8"/> teſtants, though theſe are worſe, and leſs able to derive unto us a true belief, then the pooreſt tradition (were any ſuch) that the Doctor can except againſt in the Catholick Church. When the Doctor pleaſeth, I am ready to diſcuſs this ſole point with him of proving Proteſtant Tenets by Scripture only: I believe he will not accept the Challenge.</p>
            <p>Againſt the worſhipping of Images, he cites <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, lib. 2 cap. de Orig. Error:</hi> obſerve, I beſeech you. <hi>Lactantius</hi> hath ſeven Books <hi>de Divin. Inſtit. adverſus gentes,</hi> the Title to his ſecond Book is <hi>de Origine erroris,</hi> which contains ninty Chapters; and our Doctor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully throws the Title of the whole Book into a Chapter not found at all in the Author, either in my Copy, <hi>ann.</hi> 1465. or in that extent <hi>Biblioth. Patrum ſaecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> 3. pag. 224. However Chap. 18. theſe words are found, <hi>Quare non eſt dubium, quin religio nulla ſit, ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque ſimulacrum eſt,</hi> which the Doctor unworthily tranſlates thus, <hi>Without all peradventure wherever an Image is (meaning for Worſhip) there is no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> I ſay <hi>unworthily</hi> (and it pitties me to ſee ſo much want of candor) for here a ſence is rendered, as if <hi>Lactantius</hi> declaim'd againſt the uſe and worſhip of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages among Chriſtians; whereas it is more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that he only ſpeaks againſt <hi>Simulacra,</hi> (not I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages) againſt the Idols, and Gods of the Gentils: <hi>Non ſub pedibus quaerat Deum,</hi> ſaith he, in the beginning of this eighteenth Chapter; None is to ſeek for his God under his feet: <hi>Nec a veſtigijs ſuis eruat quod adoret,</hi> Nor pull from under his footſteps what he is to adore: <hi>Sed quaerat in ſublimi, quaerat in ſummo,</hi> Let him look for God above in Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Worſhip therefore of one Supream God, <hi>Lactantius</hi> chiefly preſſeth in this whole ſecond book: In his firſt Chapter he tells us, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107258:8"/> he had above demonſtrated the falſe Religion of many Gods; and that in this ſecond Book, he declares againſt the Gentils, the cauſe or <hi>Origen</hi> of their multiplying many gods. In his ſecond Chapter he ſaith, That though the Image of a man abſent be neceſſary, yet to circumſcribe God, diffuſed every where, in any form, is both needleſs and ſuperfluous; afterward he ſhews that no deceaſed men, nor any thing in this world ought to be adored as God. In his fourth Chapter he gives this reaſon, <hi>Unde apparet iſtos deos nihil in ſe habere amplius quam materiam de quâ ſunt fabricati:</hi> Theſe gods have nothing but only the matter they are made of. In his eighth Chapter he propoſeth the queſtion how theſe falſe Gods of the Gentils did work ſtrange won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and proſecutes the ſame ſubject in his ninth Chapter. In a word, <hi>Lactantius</hi> through this whole Treatiſe, ſpeaks no more againſt the Catholick uſe of Images, then I do now while I defend them; yet hear we muſt the Doctor talk, and without all <hi>peradventure,</hi> as if he had read <hi>where an Image is, there is no Religion;</hi> without all peradventure the good man is deceived. I ſay no more: To what he next cites out of <hi>Origen,</hi> we ſhall anſwer hereafter. Now to the Doctors Chapters and Sections.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Of the Doctors ungrounded diſcourſe, to the wrongful charge on Catholicks, for making new Articles in Faith.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>TOugh my task be chiefly to follow the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in his Quotations, and note, (as he goes along) ſome few of his many Errors: Yet touch I muſt a little on a diſcourſe he is pleaſed to begin with, Chapter the firſt: It ſeems to enervate much our Chriſtian Faith, and weaken the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the moſt Ancient Councils.</p>
            <p>Page then the fourth and firſt Section, he holds the two Teſtaments, the words of Chriſt and of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the Fountains of Faith; (which none denies) but next he adds; <hi>Whatſoever caeme in after theſe,</hi> foris eſt, <hi>is to be caſt out, it belongs not unto Chriſt.</hi> This latter aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (to ſay no more) hath too much of the <hi>harſhneſs</hi> in it: for the difinitions of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Council, and of the other three general Councils, with St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed, came in after the words of Chriſt, and Holy Scripture; are theſe, Think ye, like old Garments to be laid a ſide, or <hi>caſt out,</hi> as not at all belonging to Chriſt? belong they do moſt certainly, as Rivers to their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, though not own'd as Original Springs, and the firſt Foundations of our Faith. Obſerve therefore, I beſeech you, how the Doctor deals with us, how he leads us on in darkneſs, whilſt he ſets men a ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107258:9"/> the Fountains of Faith, but with it, turns by the Stream, cuts of the Torrent of Authority whereby to find them; that is in a word, he makes null all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that can aſſert with certainty, <hi>Such were the Words of Chriſt, ſuch the Doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Judge whether I ſay not aright, and demand of the Doctor upon whoſe certain propoſal can he rely, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably admit of Chriſt's words as ſacred? If he anſwers Scripture; the Queſtion return's again, and he is asked a new, who it is that doth aſcertain him of Scripture? If the Fathers, they are, with him, Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yes, and full of ambiguous ſences. If the Church, that (ſaith he) is changeable, hath brought in novelties contrary to Ancient Faith; if Councils, not one is found but lyable to Error. Turn by therefore theſe intermedial Streams running between us and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Faith, deſtroy the certainty of ſuch Witneſſes, ſay that no man, or ſociety of men ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles hath, (without a poſſibility of erring) aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us that Chriſt ſpake, that the Evangeliſts writ as they did; the whole Scripture, God knows, will be caſt aſide alſo; yes, and become a comfortleſs, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warranted Book. Whence follow's a total ruin of Chriſtian Religion. This is not my aſſertion, but the great St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> (the Quotation is known) <hi>Tom. 6. contra epiſtolam Manichei, cap. 5. Ego vero Evangelio non crederem,</hi> &amp;c. I would not believe the Goſpel, unleſs the Authority of the Church moved me to believe it.</p>
            <p>Our Doctor may think he ſalves this objection in his next enſuing lines, pag. 4. where he ſaith; <hi>To theſe</hi> (that is to Scripture) <hi>we add, not as Authors, but as helpers of our Faith, and Heirs of the Doctrine Apoſtolical the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107258:10"/> and Catholick Doctrine of the Church in the Ages next after the Apoſtles; not that we think,</hi> &amp;c. I Anſwer: Here is, no man <hi>knows what,</hi> confuſedly ſhut up in two Ambiguous VVords; <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Helpers:</hi> to get out of darkneſs, I might firſt demand; how knows the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor now exactly, what the Sentiments, or Catholick Doctrine of the Church Anciently were in the Ages next after the Apoſtles? The Propoſal of our preſent Church (overgrown, as he ſaith, with a thouſand Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors) is an infufficient warranty: Both Fathers, and Councils were even then Fallible; and had they been Infallible, their writings ſince that, may perhaps have fallen into ill hands, and loſt their purity. But I wave this diſcourſe; and propoſe to our preſent purpoſe this Queſtion only. Are we Chriſtians now being, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged under Damnation to believe thoſe Sentiments of the Ancient Church, as undoubted <hi>Helpers,</hi> as certain apparent <hi>Heirs</hi> of Divine Truth, or no? if not: They caſt us wholly upon uncertainties, and may as well help us on to Err, as hit right: if we are bound to own them as certain <hi>Heirs</hi> of Divine Truth; Scripture muſt aſſure it, (for ſaith the Doctor, <hi>To believe any thing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that is not Scripture, is a divilliſh ſpirit</hi>) and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly affirm that at leaſt in the Ages next after Chriſt, there was a ſociety of men, not lyable to Error, that kept our Chriſtian Faith entire without ſpot or blemiſh, faithfully tranſmitted it to Poſterity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now all I can deſire of the Doctor is, to produce that Scripture, which purifies the Ancient Church only, and makes the next enſuing Ages of that Church Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Doctrine, fearfully deſpicable, and lyable to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Thus much I am confident he ſhall never ſhew: for our deareſt Saviour that Eſtabliſhed a Chriſtian Church, promiſed he would be with it to the end of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107258:10"/> World. Gods alſeeing providence drives not on his work by halfs, nor leaves his Church when the Doctors fancy liſteth: Souls are now as dear to Chriſt as they were in the Primitive Ages: He ſhed his Sacred Blood for All; if then he ſecured his Church from Error, and directed Souls into Truth; he doth the like favour now, and will not permit his Immaculate Spouſe to beguile them with falſhood.</p>
            <p>All therefore the Doctor ſaith here, is a deceitful Paralogiſm, yes, and Paradoxes, not to be tolerated. A Paradox it is, to talk of <hi>Heirs,</hi> and <hi>Helpers</hi> of Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Doctrine, and rob them of their Infallibility. A Paradox it is to ſay, that theſe <hi>Heirs,</hi> and <hi>Helpers ſent Milions of Souls into the Boſom of Christ,</hi> and caſt more Milions in after Ages out of his Boſom, for want of true Faith. A Paradox it is, that Chriſt only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with his Church for a time, and then left it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Divine Aſſiſtance; yes, and in points moſt Fundamental. But the greateſt Paradox of all which amuſes every one, is; That now towards an end of the World, a new ſort of unknown men (the Doctor is one) will become our Teachers, and tell us exactly how long Chriſt was with his Church, and when he leap'd out of it. He was with it, ſay they, for ſome three or four hundred years, and then left it, fluctuating, toſſed, and at laſt ſaw it without Mercy overturned with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of Errors. And credit this we muſt upon their bare word, becauſe they ſay it; without Sctipture, without Reaſon, yes, expreſly contrary to both, and all Ancient Authority.</p>
            <p>The Doctor to prove the Church by Scripture only, quotes St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Margent, pag. 4. <hi>de vnit. eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae cap. 3, &amp;</hi> 4. 5. but both mangles his words, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals the force of his Argument. <hi>Sunt certe</hi> (ſaith the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107258:11"/> Saint) <hi>libri Dominici quorum Authoritati utrique conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus, utrique credimus,</hi> &amp;c. There are certain books of our Lord (He means Scripture) to whoſe Authority we both yeild, we both believe: <hi>Ibi Quaeramus eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam,</hi> Let us look for the Church there <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That is, ſeeing we both, who now diſpute, admit of Scripture, and believe it, let us upon ſuch <hi>a ſuppoſition</hi> go forward and prove the Church by Scripture: which is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way of Arguing; but if any queſtion the Authority of Scripture it ſelf, take it we muſt (when we make a right Analyſis) upon the Church's Authority ſolely, and ſay with St. <hi>Auſtin:</hi> I would not believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture but for the Church.</p>
            <p>I omit the brags he hath pag. 6. of Proteſtants being more then <hi>indubitably Conquerors</hi> (meer empty words) and obſerve how he puts himſelf on a new trouble, pag. <hi>7th.</hi> where he ſaith; <hi>Whatſoever we cannot prove by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture we diſclaim it.</hi> I will not here tell the Doctor he muſt then diſclaim every Tenet of Proteſtant Religion, (no more in Scripture then Arianiſm) as it ſtands oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith: But briefly, I argue thus; A Church ſecured from Error, and which Infallibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Divine Truth can be proved by Scripture, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: If the firſt, there was, is, and ſhall ever be in the World a ſociety of Chriſtians un-crrable, and certain in Doctrine that neither injures Faith, nor (by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Novelties) deſtroy Apoſtolical Doctrine; for the Scripture, (as we now ſuppoſe) ſaith ſo, and what it ſaith is true. One favour therefore I humbly beg of the Doctor that he would by <hi>a plain deſignation</hi> point me out this unerrable body of Chriſtians; and clearly alſo deſign me ſuch known <hi>out caſt Chriſtians,</hi> that are not of this Moral body; my demand is reaſonable, and require's no long diſcourſe, nor any definition of a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107258:11"/> Church, but to have this unerring company deſign'd, and candidly.</p>
            <p>If the Scripture Warrant's not ſuch an Infallible company of Chriſtians; the Doctor (though he pretend to it) can never believe with a true, and infallible Act of Supernatural faith, that the Ancient Church Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Catholick Doctrine; that it ſent Milions of Souls to Heaven: That what we now read, is the Apoſtles Creed; that the Ancient Councils erred not in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions; No, nor that there ever was, or is now, Pure, and Incorrupt Scripture among Chriſtians: I ſay, he cannot believe theſe truths with a certain aſſent of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Faith, but at moſt with a meer opinative Judgment, which may as well be wrong, as right; falſe, as true: ſtaggering aſſuredly it is, and not ſteddy (if a meer Opinion) yes, and wholly deſtitute of that ſtrength, which God requires to Supernatural Faith.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>10th.</hi> page he is fierce againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for pretending to a power not only of declaring New Articles of Faith, but of making new Symbols, and Creeds, and impoſing them as neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To this purpoſe he cites the Bull of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth againſt <hi>Martin Luther;</hi> whoſe twenty ſeventh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is this, and condemned; <hi>Certum eſt, in manu Eccleſiae, aut Papae, non eſſe ſtatuere Articulos fidei, imo nec leges morum ſeu bonorum operum.</hi> It is certain that it is not in the hand of the Church, or Pope, to appoint, or determine Articles of Faith, nor Laws of manners, or good Works.</p>
            <p>Firſt, here is not a word of making new Articles or Creeds; and the word <hi>ſtatuere</hi> may as well ſignifie to determine a Queſtion not yet decided, as to make any thing a new; but to paſs theſe niceties, and ſhew clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107258:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Doctors Error: I demand whether the Fathers aſſembled together in the <hi>Nicen</hi> Council made new Articles of Faith againſt the <hi>Arians?</hi> whether St. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanatius</hi> in his Creed did the like? who was no Pope. What the Doctors Anſwer is here, is ours alſo for all and every Definition made by the Church in after Ages.</p>
            <p>And I would have him to reflect, that as he now ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's at both Pope, and Church, for conſtituting new Articles; ſo the <hi>Arians</hi> might have done againſt the <hi>Nicen</hi> Council, and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed; yes, and cried out, <hi>Novelties, novelties,</hi> as loud as the Doctor. In a word then, I anſwer, with St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in <hi>Ezechiel homit.</hi> XVI <hi>poſt. med.</hi> pag. 1164. 6. <hi>edit. Antwerp.</hi> 1615. that, <hi>per incrementa temporum Crevit ſcientia ſpirita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium Patrum:</hi> With time Faith encreaſed, hut how? not that either the Church or Pope have Power to coin Articles at pleaſure, or to force Chriſtians to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Novelties contrary to Scripture, or ancient Tradition; No, but the Power given them is to diſpence the Myſteries of the Word of God, to lay out more clearly verities contained in Scripture, (ſo the Fathers did in the <hi>Nicen</hi> Council, when they defined the Son to be conſubſtantial with his Father, which word <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 word">

            <p>As he deals with <hi>Anconitanus,</hi> ſo he abuſeth <hi>Panormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus cap. cum Christus;</hi> the Doctor cites him thus; <hi>Papa poteſt inducere novum Articulum fidei,</hi> and leav's of there: But <hi>Panormitan</hi>'s words are, <hi>Papa poteſt inducere novum Articulum fidei, declarando iſtud jus Divinum &amp; ex hoc infertur quod iſta Conſtitutio reſpicit praeterita.</hi> The
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107258:13"/> The Pope can introduce a new Article of Faith by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it to be Divine; whence we have, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution relates to things paſt.

            <p>Laſtly, he cites <hi>Oſtienſis,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinandus de Inciſo apud Petrum Ciezam,</hi> an Author I never heard of; but aſſuredly moſt falſe it is, that any Catholick Writer ſaies; The Souls of men are in the hands of the Pope, and that in his Arbritration Religion doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Page 12. he tells us of a ſtory of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> giving Commiſſion to purge all Catholick Authors, with ſuch ſecrecy that the Expurgatory <hi>Index</hi> might not be imparted to any. <hi>Howſoever,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> Joannes Pappus, <hi>and</hi> Franciſcus Junius 13 <hi>years after met with it, made it publick; and ſince it came abroad againſt the Inquiſitors wills; they own it, and have printed it themſelves:</hi> Yet more: in their <hi>Index,</hi> ſome words in St. <hi>Chriſoſtom,</hi> others in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> are commanded to be blotted out; yes, and <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> in his Epiſtle De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory highly commends the Pope, <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> for purging all Catholick Authors, and chiefly the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Ancient Fathers. Thus the Doctor: and he layes a foul aſpertion on us for corrupting of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and razing out the Records of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>I anſwer that he is both falſe, and faulty through this whole Paragraph; faulty, in telling us of a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular commiſſion given by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without directing us to either Book, or <hi>Index</hi> where to find it: Faulty he is, in aſſerting (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out nameing his Author) that the Inquiſitors were forced to own the Expurgatory <hi>Index,</hi> becauſe <hi>Pappus,</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:107258:14"/> had firſt printed it againſt their wills; faulty, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally he is, for citing words razed out of St. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> by an <hi>Index expurgatorius,</hi> and leaving his Reader in darkneſs where to find the Quotations.</p>
            <p>Now to his falſities which are evident: In St. <hi>Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms</hi> works (ſaith he) Printed at <hi>Baſil</hi> theſe words [<hi>The Church is not Built upon the Man, but upon the Faith</hi>] are commanded to be blotted out: yet they are read in his firſt Homily, upon that of St. <hi>Iohn, Ye are my Friends.</hi> Here are two falſities: The firſt is, that theſe words are commanded to be blotted out of St. <hi>Chriſoſtom's works;</hi> whereas, moſt certainly the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition falls only on St <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi>'s Index made by <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,</hi> Printer at <hi>Baſil,</hi> or ſome of his Friends: And is it not groſs to miſtake the Index of a Book (drawn out by God knows whom) for the Authors Doctrine? If the Reader pleaſe to ſee, that I wrong not the Doctor, let him turn to this Index publiſhed by Cardinal <hi>Sando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>'s order, and Printed at <hi>Madrid, anno</hi> 1612. pag 556. he ſhall read <hi>Ex D. Iohannis Chriſoſtomi Indice Baſileae ex officina Frobeniana, dele ſequentia:</hi> and, in the very next page (1. <hi>columna</hi>) ſoon after the middle theſe words of <hi>Frobens Index. Eccleſia non ſuper hominem, ſed ſupra fidem aedificata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Error is, that theſe words are found in the Homily now cited upon St. <hi>Iohn;</hi> believe it, there is not a ſyllable like them in that Homily. Again, ſaith the Doctor, theſe words of St. <hi>Chriſoſtom [There is no merit, but what is given us by Chriſt</hi>] are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be blotted out; yet, they are found in his Sermon upon <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> Here are three Errors at once: Firſt, the Index is taken for the Text: Secondly, <hi>Frobens</hi> words are not as the Doctor gives them, but thus: <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus noſtra non ex merito noſtro:</hi> Our Salvation is not by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107258:14"/> our merit, ſee the Index, pag. 558. 1. <hi>columna.</hi> 3. Theſe words. <hi>There is no merit,</hi> &amp;c. are not in the Homily of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> but in the other upon St. <hi>Iohn; Ye are my Friends:</hi> and as they ſtand in St. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi>'s Text, are thus (<hi>Frobens</hi> Edition) <hi>Nullum in nobis meritum niſi quod contalit Chriſtus.</hi> There is no Merit but what Chriſt gave us, which is moſt Catholick Doctrine. Again, thoſe words: <hi>The Church is not built upon the man,</hi> &amp;c. Are not in that Homily on St. <hi>Iohn, Ye are my Friends:</hi> but in St. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi>'s Homily on <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> In a word, to ſpeak plain Engliſh, our Doctor cited <hi>Kim Kam,</hi> one Homily for an other, which may paſs for a fault or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, make of it what you pleaſe. However, he may yet reply, though he miſcited the places, at leaſt grant we muſt, that thoſe words, <hi>The Church is not built upon the man,</hi> &amp;c. are extant in the <hi>Pentecoſt Homily;</hi> and the Index Expurgatory commands them to be razed out. I anſwer, that it commands them to be razed out of <hi>Frobens</hi> Index, is granted; out of St. <hi>Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi>'s works, is denyed; which yet our Doctor affirms: And herein <hi>Iohn Pappus</hi> is the more honeſt man of the two, for he ingeniouſly confeſſeth in the <hi>3d.</hi> page of his Preface, (<hi>anno</hi> 1599) that we never yet had the boldneſs to change or cancelate a word in the writings of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Authors, read his <hi>11th.</hi> line: <hi>Eo audaciae nondum proruperunt,</hi> &amp;c. The Doctor may yet demand why then purge we <hi>Frobens</hi> Index, of words found in St. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi>'s Works? I anſwer, becauſe, as they ſtand nudely in that Index deveſted of their precedent and ſubſequent words, they may render a harſher ſence to a Captious Reader, and not ſound well to any ear, though pondered with a further explication of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, they ſoon loſe the harſhneſs and clear themſelves. And ſo really is this very ſentence, if you'll compare
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107258:15"/> it with thoſe following words of St. <hi>Chriſostom</hi> in <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens</hi> Edition: <hi>Hoc eſt, ſuper confeſſionem, ſuper ſermones pietatis,</hi> &amp;c. That is, Chriſt built his Church not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>man,</hi> as <hi>man,</hi> but upon <hi>Peter,</hi> confeſſing and piouſly acknowledging his Saviours Divinity, which <hi>Fleſh and Blood taught him not,</hi> &amp;c. You ſee therefore a ſentence weighed out of its circumſtances changes often moſt blamleſs Doctrine, and ſpeaks well with them, leſs well without them. One only inſtance in Doctor <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors</hi> 167. page ſhall ſerve for our purpoſe, where he cites <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thus: <hi>If the Pope ſhould Err by commanding ſin and forbiding Virtue, the whole Church were bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Vices were good, and Virtue evil; unleſs ſhe would ſin againſt her Conſcience.</hi> Theſe words are <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin's,</hi> and as they ſtand in the Doctor, ſound harſhly, (and therefore he Quotes them) but read in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> they have an excellent ſence, and directly prove that neither Church nor Pope can Err: whereof ſee more in the 28. Chapter of this Treatiſe: So true it is, that words as they run on in the Context of an Author, are often harmleſs, though ſtript of their <hi>adjuncta,</hi> they may prove hurtful to a leſs diligent Reader. Our Doctor in his Diſſwaſive is almoſt endleſs, with theſe maimed and half-quoted Authorities.</p>
            <p>Obſerve laſtly, good Reader, how unworthily the Doctor (pag. 13.) deals with <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> by turning the Genuine ſence of his words into another, highly injurious: Mark I beſeech you. <hi>Sixtus</hi> Praiſeth Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> for purging the Ancient Fathers, vitiated by modern Hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But our Doctor (for ſooth) will not allow him this ſence, but makes him ſpeak as if he extolled the Pope for razing out the Fathers own Doctrine. To know the truth, read <hi>Sixtus</hi> his Epiſtle Dedicatory, (it is before his <hi>Bibliotheca</hi>) where he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107258:15"/> ſpeaks thus to <hi>Pius Quintus: Deinde expurgari, &amp; emaculari curaſti omnia Catholicorum Scriptorum, ac prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipuè Veterum Patrum Scripta haereticorum aetatis noſtrae fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus contaminata, &amp; venenis infecta.</hi> You have cauſed (ſaith he) all the writings of Catholick Authors, and chiefly the Ancient Fathers <hi>stained</hi> with the dreggs of Hereticks in <hi>this our Age,</hi> and poyſoned with their Venome, to be purged, and made clear from blemiſh. What is here more offenſive then to take Poyſon out of a ſound body? Yet our Doctor to perſwade the world, that Popes are ever buſie in cancelating the Records of Antiquity, gives you only <hi>Sixtus</hi> his firſt words: <hi>You have purged the Ancient Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. and there fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently leaves of, utterly concealing what follows, and clears all: <hi>Hereticorum, faecibus contaminata,</hi> &amp;c. that is, You have purged the Ancient Fathers, contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Hereſie in theſe our days.</p>
            <p>Briefly then our Doctor by this Quotation would either have his Reader judge that <hi>Sixtus</hi> praiſed the Pope for blotting out the Authentick writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or only for purging them from later Hereſie: If the ſecond, its worthy praiſe; if the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Pope is here commended for blotting out the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Ancient Fathers (which is the only thing aim'd at) I do affirm this a flat corruption, a wrong (as you ſee) to <hi>Sixtus.</hi> A ginne to catch the unwary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and therefore deplorable in a Doctor of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. What is further oppoſed in that 13. page of places razed out of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is an Error; read the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned Expurgatory Index, pag. 37. and you ſhall find the correction to be made upon <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus</hi> his Notes, not on St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> words; and page the 39, you have <hi>Cluadius Chevalonius</hi> his Index upon St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> amended, not any ſyllable of the Saint's
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107258:16"/> corrected. And this is the firſt, which our Doctor ſtorms at: <hi>Solus Deus eſt adorandus:</hi> God only is to be adored. <hi>Frobens</hi> Indices mentioned in the ſame page of our Doctor, deſerved correction, wholly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Originals.</p>

               <p>The Doctors Quotations not right: Prayer for the dead proves a Purgatory.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>TO what the Doctor hath in his <hi>2d.</hi> Section, page the <hi>14th.</hi> concerning the power of making new Articles, we have anſwered already, and ſay that the Church coyns no Novelty; yet may explicitly declare what anciently was believed <hi>implicitly.</hi> The Declaration is new, the ſubſtance of the Article as old as Chriſtianity: In the next page after, he had a fling at a new Article ready for ſtamp concerning the Immaculate Conception of the Bleſſed Virgin, (which is more then he knows) He paſſeth to his third Section of Indulgences, page 16. where he cites St. <hi>Antoninus Arch-Biſhop of</hi> Florence <hi>parte 1. ſummae cap.</hi> 3. ſaying, <hi>We have nothing expreſly for Indulgences in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture &amp;c.</hi> The Doctor omits what follows imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; <hi>quamvis ad hoc inducatur illud Apoſtoli 2. cor. 2. ſi quid donavi vobis propter vos in perſona Chriſti.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſaith <hi>Antoninus,</hi> that of the Apoſtle is alledged, <hi>ſi quid,</hi> &amp;c. He cites again our Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi> in Art.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107258:16"/> 18. <hi>Lutheri</hi> to this ſence; <hi>At the beginning of the Church there was no uſe of Indulgences.</hi> Anſwer, he ſaith it not ſo abſolutely, but with this interrogation; <hi>Quis jam de Indulgentjis mirari poteſt?</hi> and expreſly in the beginning of that Article hath theſe words: <hi>Fuit tamen non nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus earum uſus, ut aiunt, apud Romanos vetuſtiſſimus, quod vel ex ſtationibus in urbe frequentiſſimis intelligi datur.</hi> There was, as they ſay, a moſt ancient Uſe and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of theſe Indulgences at <hi>Rome,</hi> which thing the moſt frequented Stations of that City gives us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
            <p>In the reſt of that Section, he hath only Vulgar Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections anſwered over and over, and a number of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies a riſing from the miſunderſtanding of Catholick Doctrine: I therefore leave him, for it is not my task to repeat what hath been moſt largely writ concerning Indulgences by others.</p>
            <p>What I find more material in the Doctors fourth Section is, page 27. <hi>Where he tells us our Writers vainly ſuppoſe, that when the H. Fathers ſpeak of Prayer for the dead, they conclude for Purgatory; For it is true, ſaith he, the Fathers did Pray for the dead; But how? that God would ſhew them Mercy, and haſten their Reſurrection,</hi> &amp;c. Mark well, that <hi>God would ſhew them Mercy:</hi> whence <hi>I argue,</hi> if the Souls prayed for, be in Heaven, they have Mercy, the ſentence is given for their Eternal happineſs; if in Hell, they are wholly deſtitute of Mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vain therefore were the Prayers of the Fathers for Mercy, unleſs there be a third place where mercy can be ſhewed them. I would willingly know of the Doctor (if he would deal candidly) what St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> ingenious meaning was when he prayed thus for his Mother <hi>Monica lib. 9. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ. cap. 13. Dimitte illi &amp; tu, debita ſua, ſi qua etiam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traxerit post tot annos poſt aquam ſalutis:</hi> Forgive my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107258:17"/> her debts, if ſhe hath, after ſo many years contracted any, ſince Baptiſm: What are theſe debts? Again, <hi>Non ſe interponat, nec vi, nec inſidiis Leo, vel Draco; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que enim reſpondebit illa, nihil ſe debere, ne convincatur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sed reſpondebit dimiſſa debita ſua ab eo,</hi> &amp;c. Let not that Infernal Enemy, intermeddle by his force, or treachery; ſhe will not anſwer that ſhe owes nothing, leaſt ſhe be convicted, but will ſay her debts are remitted by him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Afterwards he beggs of his Brethren to Pray for his deceaſed Mother, at the Altar; and above in the ſame Chapter ſpeaking to Almighty God, he gives this reaſon why he Prayes: <hi>Quia vero non requiris de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licta vehementer, fiducialiter ſperamus aliquem apud te lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum inveniri Indulgentiae:</hi> Becauſe you deal not ſeverely with offences; confident we are that a place for Mercy may be found, for Pardon and Remiſſion; that is in plain language for Remiſſion of Pains: But in Heaven all is remitted, in Hell there is nothing forgiven. Let the Doctor make here the inference, and conclude for Purgatory: There is no avoyding it.</p>
            <p>Yet he goes on: <hi>It is to be remembred that they (the Fathers) made prayers, and offered for thoſe, who by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of all ſides, never were in Purgatory; for the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks, Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and eſpecially for the Bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary: <hi>So we find in</hi> Epiphanius, <hi>and Saint</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril.</p>
            <p>The Doctor here is both out, and unlucky in his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: firſt, there is not one word (in either place ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) of the Bleſſed Virgin. Secondly, Not a ſyllable of Pardon, or Remiſſion of Debts, when a memory is made of Patriarks, Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which is only to the purpoſe) but expreſly the contrary. Be pleaſed to hear St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> Hereſie 75. where he ſpeaks thus: <hi>Pro juſtis, &amp; peccatoribus memoriam facimus, pro peccatoribus qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107258:17"/> miſericordiam Dei implorantes, pro justis vero, &amp; Patribus, &amp; Patriarchis, Prophetis, Apoſtolis, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ut dominum Ieſum ab hominum ordine ſeparemus per honorem quem ipſi exhibemus, &amp; adorationem ipſi praeſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> that is, We remember both juſt men, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; for ſinners we implore Mercy; for the juſt, and for the Ancient Fathers, and Patriarks, Prophets, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we may ſeperate our Lord Jeſus from the Order of men (living) by the honour we exhibit, and adoration we give him. Here is no praying for Patriarks, and Apoſtles, to have Pardon, or Remiſſio (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did for his Mother) but a memory of them to honour Chriſt Jeſus. St. <hi>Cyril</hi> alſo cited <hi>Catech. Myſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog.</hi> 5. is more plain againſt the Doctor: (<hi>Cum hoc ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium offerimus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>poſtea facimus memoriam etiam eorum omnium qui ante nobis obdormierunt, primùm Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archarum, Prophetarum, Apoſtolorum, Martyrum, ut Deus</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107258:18"/> &amp; nobis, &amp; illis eum qui benigniſſimus eſt, propitium redda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> In like manner we pray for departed ſinners, not making them a Crown, but we offer up Chriſt ſlain for our ſins, to make him who is moſt benign, propitious, and favourable both to our ſelves, and departed ſinners: Unluckily, I ſay; did the Doctor make uſe of this place in his Diſſwaſive from Popery, which is all over old Popiſh Doctrine. Firſt, a memory is made of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks, Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not to have Pardon, or Remiſſion; but that God <hi>by their Prayers</hi> accept of ours: Plain Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. 2. We pray for all the deceaſed, believing thoſe Souls are mightily benefitted, for whom that holy and dreadful Sacrifice of the Altar is offered: Two points of Popery more. 3. We offer Chriſt Jeſus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, <hi>mactatum,</hi> ſlain on the Altar; to the end that we may make Almighty God, who is moſt benign, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and propitious, both to our ſelves, and to the dead. Still nothing but Popery.</p>
            <p>By what is here ſaid, you may ſee the fraud of the Doctor, who unlearnedly argues thus: The Fathers prayed as well for Saints, as ſinners, <hi>Ergo,</hi> from prayer for the dead no concluſion for Purgatory. Anſwer: Theſe Fathers made a memory of <hi>B.</hi> Saints, as the Church ſtill doth, but never prayed that they might be releaſed from puniſhment, or have their debts forgiven, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did for his Mother. Here then is the true Argument, and a moſt efficatious one: The Fathers prayed for deceaſed Souls, that they might have Mercy, Pardon, and Remiſſion of Debts contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this life: They prayed that God would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious, and favourable to them; and for this end of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up Chriſt Jeſus <hi>Sacrificed</hi> on the Altar: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fathers ſuppoſed a place, where Mercy, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and Remiſſion might be had, where God can ſhew
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107258:18"/> himſelf propitious to them, and the unbloody Sacrifice may be offered on the Altar, for the cancelling their debts, and abating their torments. But this place is neither Heaven nor Hell, in the one, all debts are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; in the other is no Remiſſion: <hi>Ergo,</hi> a third place or Purgatory is hence rightly concluded.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The Doctors Quotations ſtill amiſs. <hi>St. Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Otho Friſingenſis</hi> are abuſed by him.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Doctor, page 30. cites St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Otho Friſingenſis</hi> againſt the Doctrine of Purgatory, but plainly corrupts both. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his <hi>Enchiridion, cap.</hi> 69. and <hi>lib. 21. de civitate cap.</hi> 26. as one that doubts of Purgatory: By the way our Adverſary, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> go higher, and expreſly condemn the Doctrine of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. So the Doctor, page 28. which is more then St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> dared to venture on: But let that paſs: He gives you St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> words in Engliſh thus: <hi>Whether Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory be to be found or not, may be inquired, and poſſibly it may be found, and poſſibly it may never.</hi> Anſw. There are no ſuch words; <hi>and poſſibly it may never:</hi> in either place of St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> but here is the leaſt of Errors, for the whole drift of the Saints diſcourſe is miſtaken, who firſt lays this Principle in his precedent Chapter 68. that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107258:19"/> 
               <hi>ſome are Purged by the Fire of Tribulation, or Grief for the loſs of Temporal Goods in this Life, yet keep to the True Foundation which is Christ; and ſuch a man is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (ſaith St.</hi> Auſtin) <hi>as it were by the Fire of Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Next he gives the reaſon of this aſſertion, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: <hi>Quia urit eum rerum dolor, quas dilexerat, amiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe the grief he has for things he loved, torments him, yet ſhakes not the Foundation he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed withal; As who would ſay, he hath a ſence for the loſs of Temporals, yet the Foundation is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
            <p>Upon this reaſon: <hi>Quia urit eum rerum dolor,</hi> &amp;c. theſe words immediately follow, <hi>cap. 69. Tale aliquid etiam fieri poſt hanc vitam incredibile non eſt. Et utrum ita ſit quaeri poteſt; &amp; aut inveniri aut latere nonnullos fideles per ignem quendam purgatorium quanto magis minuſuè bona pereuntia dilexerunt, tanto tardiùs citiùſque ſaluari:</hi> That ſuch a like thing be alſo after this life, is not incredible: What is not incredible? [Mark well the connection between <hi>urit eum dolor rerum amiſſarum,</hi> and the enſuing words: <hi>Tale aliquid etiam poſt hanc vitam fieri non eſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibile.</hi>] This is not incredible, that as ſome are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in this life, for their too much affection to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commodities, by grief for the loſs of them; ſo likewiſe it is not incredible, that they ſuffer a torment in thoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging flames upon that account: Of this particular pain, ſaith the Saint, we may inquire, whether it be a part of Purgatory, or no? whether faithful Souls find it there, or it be yet latent? Find what I beſeech you? <hi>Quanto magis, minùſue,</hi> &amp;c. that by <hi>How much more, or leſs they loved their periſhing goods, ſo much ſooner, or later they are ſaved, and come to Heaven:</hi> Which laſt words plainly gives us St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> meaning, and ſhew that he doubted not of a Purgatory (which he here ſuppoſeth)
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107258:19"/> but calls into queſtion ſuch a particular pain, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory of leſſer tranſgreſſions. The ground of all is taken out of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Doctrine, who much inclined to this Opinion, that leſſer offences are uſually purged by the fire of Tribulation in this Life. So <hi>Suarez</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>Tom. 4. in 3. part. diſp. 45. nu. 23. Fine. Et ideo dixit Auguſtinus, haec peccata leviora in hoc ſaeculo purgari per Tribulationem.</hi> And therefore St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid that theſe leſſer ſins are purged by Tribulation in this life. See his 41. Sermon <hi>de ſanctis Tom.</hi> 10. where he firſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth between great ſins, and little ones; then ſhews the penalty due to both: Finally, concludes thus of leſſer ſins (and he ſpecifies the too much love of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſtance) <hi>Ita peccata ipſa in hoc ſaeculo purgantur, ut in futuro ille ignis purgatorius, aut non inveniat, aut certe parum inveniat quod exurat.</hi> So theſe leſſer ſins are purged in this Life, that in the next the fire of Purgatory will not either find at all, or truly very little to puniſh. The Saint goes on: <hi>Si autem nec in tribulatione Deo gratias egimus, nec bonis operibus peccata redimimus, ipſi tamdiu in illo igne purgatorio moras habebimus quamdiu ſupradicta peccata minuta tanquam ligna, faenum, ſtipula, conſumantur.</hi> But if in our Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we neither give thanks to God, nor redeem our ſins by good works; we ſhall ſtay in Purgatory until thoſe above mentioned little ſins, like Wood, Hay, and Stubble be conſumed. Thus the Saint, who may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally inquire, as he doth; yes, and affirm, that thoſe leſſer tranſgreſſions are uſually cancelled by the fire of Tribulation in this Life. The Doctor perhaps will ſay: Theſe Sermons <hi>de ſanctis</hi> are not St. <hi>Auſtins,</hi> for-ſooth, becauſe they pleaſe not his Lordſhip: Let him prove this Sermon now cited is not. The ſame certitude, ſaith <hi>Bellar. de ſeript. Eccleſiaſ.</hi> cannot be had of thoſe Sermons; yet credible it is, that for the moſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107258:20"/> part they are St. <hi>Auſtins.</hi> Be it how you will, they are of greater Authority then any the Doctor can give us againſt Purgatory. I hope the 2. Books <hi>de geneſi contra Manichaeos,</hi> are undoubtedly St. <hi>Auſtins:</hi> Let the Doctor read the <hi>20th</hi> Chapter of his <hi>2d.</hi> Book: <hi>Fine;</hi> he ſhall find theſe words, <hi>qui forte agrum ſuum non colu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit, &amp; ſpinis eum opprimi permiſerit, habet in hac vita maledictionem terrae ſuae in omnibus operibus ſuis, &amp; poſt hanc vitam habebit vel ignem purgationis, vel paenam aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam.</hi> He that cultivates not his Field, but ſuffers it to be over grown with Thorns, hath a curſs on him in all he doth; and after this life, ſhall either have a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, or ſuffer pains for ever. St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> Books, <hi>de civitate</hi> were never doubted of: Read the 16. Chapter of his 21. Book, where he ſaith: If one be regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Sacraments of Chriſt our Lord (as by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm) and ſo paſs from the power of darkneſs, <hi>&amp;c. Non ſolum in paenis non praeparetur aeternis, ſed ne ulla quidem poſt mortem purgatoria tormenta patiatur.</hi> Hath not only any Eternal puniſhment prepared for him, but not ſo much, as any purging torments after death. Again, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. he diſtinguiſheth a double Fire, the one Eternal, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he calls a Fire, <hi>Qui emundabit eos qui per ignem ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui erunt,</hi> which is more grievous then any torment in this world: It would be endleſs to produce other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities for Purgatory.</p>
            <p>Now to <hi>Otho Friſingenſis</hi> whom the Doctor cites <hi>lib. 8. Croni. cap.</hi> 26. and ſaith, <hi>Purgatory in his time was got no farther then to a quidam aſſerunt:</hi> Some ſay there is one. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Doctor ſaith, He knows not what, and ſtrangely abuſeth this Author; Famous both for Vertue, and Nobility. In a word; The Title of that 26. Chapter is this: <hi>Si poſt judicium extra infernum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriorem, &amp;c.</hi> Whether after the day of Judgement
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107258:20"/> any place for leſſer pain remains out of Hell, and what is to be thought of little ones who have Original ſin on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus the Title, which meddles not with Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: The Chapter then begins; <hi>His dictis indagandum puto ſi tranſacto judicio extra infernum inferiorem ad leviores paenas locus remaneat; eſſe quippe apud inferos locum purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium, in quo ſalvandi, vel tenebris tantum afficiantur, vel expiationis igne decoquantur &amp;c.</hi> We are to inquire, ſaith <hi>Otho,</hi> whether, when Judgement is paſt, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a place for lighter puniſhment out of Hell, for there is place of Purgatory [<hi>apud inferos</hi>] amongſt thoſe that are under ground, wherein ſaved Souls are in darkneſs, and tormented with Fire. Then follows the <hi>quidam aſſerunt</hi> of the Doctor which relates not to Purgatory, but to that other place after Judgment, whereof <hi>Otho</hi> makes inquiry, and he anſwers negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch a place, when all cauſes are heard in the General Judgment, remains not; though ſome Fathers inclined to think the contrary: <hi>See Lactan. lib. 7. cap.</hi> 21. and <hi>Origen Homil.</hi> 14. in <hi>Lucam,</hi> and theſe perhaps <hi>Otho</hi> impugned: Next he diſcourſeth how In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, that dye with Original ſin only, are to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether with a milder pain or no? Here is the ſubſtance of that Chapter. I could wiſh the Doctor would read thoſe words of <hi>Otho,</hi> towards the end of this 26. Chapter [<hi>Quod ſi locus etiam ille ſuperior, non ut prius ad purgationem</hi>] which manifeſtly declare the Authors meaning, nothing God knows contrary to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</p>
            <p>Pag. the 33. he cites <hi>Maldonat,</hi> alledging divers Greek Fathers denying that the Souls of the dead <hi>ever do appear:</hi> what is that to our purpoſe of Purgatory? <hi>Maldonat</hi> gives you St. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>ins</hi> ſevere cenſure againſt them, and a proof is evident. <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107258:21"/> to our Saviour in Mount <hi>Tabor: Ergo,</hi> Souls do appear.</p>
            <p>The Authorities he brings againſt Purgatory, pag. 34. are both ſo weak, and vulgar, that they deſerve no anſwer. <hi>There is no place of Penance,</hi> ſaith, he out of St. <hi>Ciprian, There is no Effect of Satisfaction. Anſw.</hi> Moſt true doubtleſs; for this life is the place allotted for wholeſome penance. In Purgatory there is no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious ſatisfaction. I ſee not where the leaſt ſhadow of a difficulty lyes in his next Quotation out of St. <hi>Denis, Eccleſiaſ. Hierarch. cap.</hi> 7. whoſe words faithfully ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered are theſe. <hi>Thoſe that have lived holily, looking on the true promiſes of God, as if they ſaw the verity of them in his Reſurrection, with firm and true hope, full of Divine joy, go to the extremity of death, as to an end of their holy conflicts</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. (to wit in this life) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Saint adds: <hi>Becauſe they certainly know that all their conflicts for their future and entire Reſurrection, will be ſafe in a perfect and Eternal Life.</hi> He goes on. <hi>For holy Souls while they are in this life, can be changed to worſe; but in the ſecond Reſurrection by a likeneſs they have with God, they cannot be changed.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Denis.</hi> Now let the Doctor make his Argument: Holy men relying on Gods promiſes full of Hope and Joy, conſider death as an end of their conflicts in this World, knowing a happy Reſurrection will recompence their grievances: <hi>Ergo,</hi> there is no purgatory or penal ſuffering hereafter. A moſt powerful Argument. Had the Doctor only reflected on what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cites <hi>lib. 1. de Purgatorio cap. 10. initio.</hi> out of this very <hi>7th.</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> he would never have troubled the Reader with ſo unweigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty an Objection. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> relates St. <hi>Denis</hi> his words thus: <hi>Accedens deinde Venerandus Antistes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Venerable Prelate, then coming, makes his Prayer over the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107258:21"/> dead, and that Prayer is to begg for Gods Clemency, that he remit all ſins done by the deceaſed party, through humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and ſet him in a place of Light, and the Region of the Living.</hi> The ſubſtance hereof you have, <hi>Biblio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theca Patrum ſaeculo 1.

            </p>
            <p>Next the Doctor cites St. <hi>Iuſtin Martyr queſti. &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpons ad Orthodoxos queſti.</hi> 75. ſaying, <hi>That when the Soul is parted from the body, <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> where they have the Converſation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Take notice firſt, how the Doctor varies from himſelf; page 29. Where we heard him ſpeak thus: <hi>Sixtus Senenſis ſaies, and ſaies very true, That</hi> Juſtin Martyr <hi>did affirm, that before the day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſouls of men are kept in ſecret receptacles, reſerved to the ſentence of the great Day; and that before then, no man receives according to his works done in this Life:</hi> Here, <hi>preſently,</hi> the Souls are carryed into Paradiſe, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, If <hi>Iuſtins</hi> Authority be for the Doctors pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, otherwiſe there is a third place. Theſe Souls therefore make a long demur, after their ſeparation from their body in ſecret Receptacles even to the Day of Judgment, and yet are carryed preſently into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Let him that can, accord theſe two Aſſertions; and learn moreover, that <hi>Iuſtin</hi> only ſays, the ſeparation of the Juſt and Unjuſt is made preſently <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 span">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107258:22"/> two Final places of Wo and Happineſs, for two ſorts of men, which is no way inconſiſtent with an interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial place of Purgatory, or <hi>atrium Caeli.</hi> Thus much is ſaid to comply with the Doctor, who cannot but know, that theſe Queſt. and <hi>Reſpon. ad Orthodox.</hi> are not <hi>Iuſtin Martyrs.</hi> See <hi>Bellar. de Script. Eccl.</hi> The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> next following, aſſerting <hi>That death is a Haven of Reſt, and makes not our condition worſe, &amp;c.</hi> is an excellent ſaying; for worſe he is not, but infinitly better, that quit of the occaſions of living here, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained of future Bliſs hereafter; which is the whole drift of the Saint in that fourth Chap. <hi>de bono mort is</hi> cited by the Doctor. Read it, and ſay afterwards, whether I ſay not true.</p>
            <p>The Doctor quotes again St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> in his <hi>5th.</hi> Oration in <hi>Plagam grandinis;</hi> by his good leave 'tis the <hi>15th.</hi> not the <hi>5th.</hi> as I have ſeen in three Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that which I follow is <hi>Paris</hi> Print, <hi>anno</hi> 1609. pag. 249. his words, after he had mentioned the calamities of this World, are <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I omit to ſpeak of thoſe great Tribunals in the next life, to which pardon and impunity in this delivers them; ſo that it is much better to be chaſtiſed and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged now, then to be ſent to puniſhment (to wit, thoſe Tribunals.) Now is a time of penalty, <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> not of Purgation: Therefore ſays the Doctor, there is no Purgatory: I ſay contrary, that the Saint ſpeaks not a word of Purgatory, but only denies a purgation of Life and Manners after thoſe Tribunals: The following particles (fraudulently omitted by the Doctor) make my aſſertion evident; for ſays St. <hi>Gregory: As he that is mindful of God, is ſuperior to death, ſo to the departed,</hi> (as holy <hi>David</hi> affirms) <hi>Non eſt in Inferno confeſſio nec mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum correctio, So in Hell there is no confeſſion, nor correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Conformable to this, <hi>Olimpiodorus</hi> cited by the Doctor, ſpeaks in <hi>Eccleſ. cap.</hi> 11. his words are <hi>Biblioth. patrum Com. 2. Paris</hi> Print 1624. pag. 670. <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 span">

The Doctor laſtly cites St. <hi>Leo Epiſt.</hi> 59. for words not found at all in that Epiſtle: he writes to <hi>Martianus,</hi> and gives thanks for peace reſtored to the Church, by the Great Council of <hi>Calcedon.</hi> See this Epiſtle <hi>Colen</hi> Print 1561. Pittyful it is to ſee ſuch ſtrengthleſs Authorities produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, not only againſt the expreſs Teſtimony of other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aſſerting Purgatory, but more, againſt the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Univerſal Church.</p>
            <p>But I know not by what chance we have miſſed a former Argument of our Doctor againſt Purgatory: He hath it pag. 29. and ſpeaks thus: <hi>Sixtus Senenſis ſaies, and ſaies very true, That many Fathers, as</hi> Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian, <hi>St.</hi> Bernard, <hi>and others did affirm, that the Souls of men before the Day of Iudgment are kept in ſecret Receptacles reſerved unto the ſentence of the great Day,</hi> &amp;c. Then he Argues: <hi>if this Opinion be true;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107258:23"/> the Doctrine of Purgatory is falſe; or if not true, it is inconſiſtent with an Opinion of Fathers ſo generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Anſw.</hi> The Doctor hath not one true word in this Objection; falſe it is, that <hi>Sixtus</hi> ſo peremptorily aſcribs this Opinion to the Fathers, he rather makes it his work to interpret them favourably; and to do it, diſtinguiſheth a double beatitude, the one imperfect of Soul only, the other conſummat and perfect of Soul and Body; the firſt, the Fathers called by ſeveral names of <hi>ſinus Abrahae, Atrium Dei, ſub altare,</hi> &amp;c. the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>perfect Ioy, the Glory of the Reſurrection, and entire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of merits, a time of Coronation,</hi> &amp;c. And this later they held was not till the day of Judgment. Read <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus lib. 6. Bibliot.

            <argument>
               <p>The Doctors cavils againſt Tranſubſtantiation. His falſe Quotations. His impertiment Queſtions and weak Arguments.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Doctor in his <hi>5th.</hi> Section, pag. 36. falls upon the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, where he bruſhes up a few old duſty Arguments anſwered every where by our Writers. <hi>We know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the very time it began to be publickly owned, the very Council,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw. Arius</hi> might have ſaid thus much againſt the Conſubſtantiality of the Son of God with his Father, and made it a Novelty, firſt owned by the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> The vulgar, ſolid, and true an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is; that the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believed in the Church, though more fully, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly declared in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council. I ſay, <hi>Was ever believed,</hi> for if the moſt eminent Fathers that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, told us <hi>that Bread is changed out of his Nature into the Body of Chriſt: That by Holy Invocation, it is no more common Bread: That as Water in</hi> Cana <hi>of</hi> Galilee <hi>was changed into
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107258:24"/> Wine; ſo in the Evangeliſt Wine is changed into Blood: That Bread is only Bread before the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Words, but after Conſecration, is made the Body of Chriſt.</hi> If Ancient Fathers ſpeak thus, (as moſt certainly they do, every Polemical Writer furniſheth you with theſe Teſtimonies) conclude we muſt that they either cheated the World into a falſe belief, or held as we do, the real Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation. But my task is not ſo much to prove Catholick Doctrine (already done by innumerable Authors) as to ſhew you our Doctors faylings in his Quotations; page there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 37. he cites <hi>Scotus,</hi> ſaying, that before the <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Council, Tranſubſtantiation was not an Article of Faith, as <hi>Bellarm.</hi> confeſſes. Moſt willingly would I have the Doctor to point me out the diſtinction and queſtion where <hi>Scotus</hi> affirms this; ſome cite him in 4. <hi>diſtin. 11. q.</hi> 3. where he only ſaith (in all Editions I have ſeen,) that the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation was more explicitly defined there, but not firſt made an Article of Faith.</p>
            <p>But the Famous (or rather infamous Quotation) is out of <hi>Petrus Lombardus</hi> (uſually called <hi>Magiſter Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiarum</hi>) the Doctor hath it (to his diſgrace) page 38. after he had ſaid, that Tranſubſtantiation was ſo far then from being an Article of Faith, that they knew not whether it where true, or no; yes, and that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus Lombardus</hi> could not tell whether there was a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial change or no.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you mark an unexcuſable Error, <hi>Petrus Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardus, lib. 4. diſtinct. 11. lit. A.</hi> begins thus: <hi>Si autem quaeritur qualis ſit iſta converſio, an formalis, an ſubſtantialis, definire non ſufficio,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If it be asked what kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion this is, whether formal, or ſubſtantial, I am not ſufficient to define:</hi> obſerve the word (<hi>define.</hi>) Then
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107258:24"/> he ſets down ſeveral Opinions much in thoſe words the Doctor hath. To theſe Opinions, or Objections, where the Doctor leaves off fraudulently, <hi>Lombardus</hi> anſwers <hi>lit. B. Quibus hoc modo reſponderi poteſt, quia non ea ratione dicitur corpus Chriſti confici verbo caeleſti, quod ipſum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus in conceptu virginis deinceps formetur: ſed quia ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia panis, vel vini quae ante non fuerat corpus Chriſti, vel ſanguis, verbo caelesti fit corpus, &amp; ſanguis, &amp; ideo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotes dicuntur conficere corpus Christi, &amp; ſanguinem, quia eorum miniſterio ſubſtantia panis fit caro, &amp; ſubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia vini fit ſanguis Chriſti, nec tamen aliquid additur cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pori, vel ſanguini, nec augetur corpus Chriſti, vel ſanguis:</hi> To which we anſwer thus: Chriſt's Sacred Body is not ſaid after that manner, made by a Heavenly word, that 'tis framed a new in the Virgin, but becauſe the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of Bread and Wine, which before were not the Body and Blood of Chriſt; by the Heavenly Word of Conſecration is made that Body, and Blood; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Prieſts are ſaid to make Chriſt's Body and Blood, becauſe by their work, or Miniſtry, the Subſtance of Bread is made the Fleſh of Chriſt and the Subſtance of Wine is made his Blood, yet nothing is added to that Body and Blood, neither are made more, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. Thus <hi>Lombardus</hi> anſwers the Objection which the Doctor only ſets down; and therefore in plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh he deals with his Reader, as Sr. <hi>Morney Pleſſy</hi> once did with Cardinal <hi>Peron;</hi> he gives you the Objections for <hi>Lombards</hi> own doctrine: that this is moſt evidently <hi>Lombards</hi> Doctrine, <hi>lit. D.</hi> clears all; chiefly towards the end: <hi>Non ſunt tamea multa corpora Chriſti, ſed unum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, &amp; unus ſanguis, ideoque ſive plus, ſive minus quis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de percipiat, omnes aequaliter corpus Chriſti integerrimè ſumunt; poſt conſecrationem ergo non eſt ſubſtantia panis, vel vini, licet ſpecies remaneant, eſt enim ſpecies panis &amp;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107258:25"/> vini, ſicut &amp; ſapor, unde aliud videtur, aliud intelligitur.</hi> Yet there are not many bodies of Chriſt, but one only Body and Blood; and therefore though any take more or leſs, all equally, and wholly take the Body of Chriſt. After the Conſecration then, there is no <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of Bread and Wine, although the ſpecies of Bread and Wine remain, as alſo the taſt, wherefore one thing is ſeen, and another is underſtood. Never did <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, or any Catholick Author ſpeak more plainly for Tranſubſtantiation: To be ſure of what I here affirm, I have read two Editions of <hi>Petrus Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,</hi> that which was Printed at <hi>Loven, anno</hi> 1546. and the other, moſt uſual, with <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries.</p>
            <p>The Doctor next quotes <hi>Durandus lib. 4. ſent. diſtinc. 11. qu. 1. Sect. Propter tertium,</hi> who, ſaies he, <hi>Publickly maintained that after conſecration the very matter of Bread remain'd, although he ſaies by reaſon of the Authority of the Church it is not to be held.</hi> I Anſwer, That <hi>Durand</hi> in all that firſt queſtion hath not a word like what the Doctor aſſerts; read him Art. 3. he plainly maintains the Catholick Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely concludes that the Subſtance of Bread and Wine are converted into Chriſts Body. All he hath, <hi>Sectio propter tertium</hi> is, <hi>that the Words of Chriſt might be verified, although the Body were preſent with Bread,</hi> which is a Theological diſputation, and neither clears the Doctor for his abuſing <hi>Durand,</hi> nor advanceth him one whit in his cavils againſt Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Page 40. and 41. he gives you a few weak Authorities againſt our Doctrine, and thinks to confute all by the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen;</hi> cited page 42. <hi>Orat. 2. in Paſeha:</hi> The Oration is long, and the Doctor
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107258:25"/> well might either by page or number have helped his Reader to find the place; but thus he deals with you often, and far worſe afterwards. Well, St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Works Printed at <hi>Antwerp 1612. Orat. 2. in Paſcha</hi> pag. 261. <hi>nu.</hi> 5. ſaith, <hi>Iam vero Paſchalis partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes erimus, nunc quidem adhuc typice, tametſi apertius licet quam in veteri; legale ſiquidem paſcha (nec enim dicere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebor) figurae figura erat obſcurior.</hi> Theſe words the Doctor gives you in Engliſh, and what conclude they againſt Tranſubſtantiation? nothing; for were the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Body of our Deareſt Lord preſent in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, with the ſubſtance of Bread, were it (as it now is) really preſent without the ſubſtance of Bread; In St. <hi>Gregori's</hi> ſence, Chriſt <hi>concealed</hi> under the ſpecies of Bread may be rightly called a Figure of its own ſelf, more clearly hereafter to be ſhewed us in Heaven: For as the legal <hi>Paſcha</hi> was a Figure, becauſe it more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely pointed out this true one in the New Law: So this alſo, where Chriſt Jeſus is concealed from our ſences, may be rightly called a Figure, becauſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits not moſt clearly that Saviour we ſhall ſee with greateſt clarity in Heaven. This ſence is gathered out of St. <hi>Gregories</hi> next enſuing words (which the Doctor wholly omits) <hi>Figurae erat figura obſcurior</hi> (ſaith the Saint) <hi>aliquam poſt autem perfectius, &amp; purius, tum vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet, cum verbum novum illud nobiſcum in regno Patris bibet, pate faciens &amp; docens, quae nunc plane demonſtravit.</hi> The <hi>legal</hi> Paſcha <hi>was a more obſcure Figure of this Figure which we ſhall afterward ſee perfectly, and with greater clarity; to wit, when the new Word ſhall drink it with us in his Fathers Kingdom, laying open himſelf, and teaching us thoſe things which now he hath fully demonſtrated.</hi> Mark theſe laſt words, very uſeful to explicate other Authorities where mention
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107258:26"/> is made of a Sign, a Type, and Figure in this matter; but they are neither for, or againſt Tranſubſtantiation, unleſs the Doctor ſhews (which he ſhall never) that Chriſts Sacred Body is ſo barely Figured in this <hi>Paſcha,</hi> that it is not alſo really preſent. <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius</hi> cited, pag. 43. are anſwered in every Book by our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The nature of the Symbols, or Signs are not changed; that is, the Species, or accidents of Bread and Wine remain; theſe recide not from their nature: Grace is added. What is here againſt Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation?</p>
            <p>I paſs by thoſe witty queſtions which the Doctor moves, pag. 45. What if a Prieſt ſays: <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum, over all the Bread in a Bakers ſhop?</hi> doth he turn it into Chriſts Body? the like queſtion is, And what if a Miniſter ſay the ſame words over the ſame Bread, doth he turn it into Holy and Sanctifyed Bread? may the People kneel down, and take this as Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? Again, <hi>Whether a Church-Mouſe doth eat her Maker?</hi> And what if a Mouſe, or a viler Creature had bit the Sacred body of our Saviour laid in <hi>Bethlem</hi> Stable, had they bit their Maker? Away with theſe Trifles, they become not a Doctor of Divinity. And be pleaſed,</p>
            <p>To reflect on one doubty Argument he hath, page 46. which is indeed preſſing, but how? to ſhew that he knows not our Catholick Doctrine. <hi>Since ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they ſay that every conſecrated wafer is Christs whole Body, and yet this wafer is not that Wafer, therefore either this or that is not Chriſts Body, or elſe Christ hath two Bodies, for there are two Wafers.</hi> My God! what is here? out of two Wafers he inferrs two Bodies, as if one from the two parts in man, his Head, and Feet ſhould infer a neceſſity of two Souls, or conclude there
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107258:26"/> are two Gods, one in Heaven and the other in Earth, becauſe Heaven and Earth are more diſtinct then two Wafers. That known paſſage of St. <hi>Auſtin, Ferebatur in manibus ſuis in Pſal.</hi> 33. When Chriſt ſitting at the Table with his Diſciples, gave them his Sacred Body, (<hi>Ferebat enim illud corpus in manibus ſuis,</hi> ſaith the Saint) might well have learned the Doctor, that then there were not two Chriſts at the Table. Had he read what I cited above out of <hi>Petrus Lombard: Non ſunt tamen mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta corpora Chriſti ſed unum corpus,</hi> &amp;c. He might well have ſpared the labour of this Argument.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the Doctors weak Arguments againſt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion under one kind. Of his ſleight impugning Prayer in an unknown Language. Of his ill Quotations.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Doctor in his 6 Section, pag. 47. treats (as he calls it) of half Communion, that is of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Holy Sacrament in one kind only; and beſides a few vulgar Objections ſolved by every Catholick Writer he has nothing. That which he alledgeth out of <hi>Paſchaſius Rathbertus</hi> ſuppoſeth a Law or practice in the Church for Communicating in both kinds: Would to God our Doctor had reflected on what this good Abbot hath in the beginning of his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107258:27"/> 19. Chapter, where he plainly acknowledgeth that the Blood which is in the Chalice is the very ſame that flowed out of the Sacred Side of our Saviour; ſo far at leaſt <hi>Rathbertus</hi> was a Papiſt, and never ſaid that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kinds is, or was commanded by Chriſt our Lord. Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> his Authority is ſo often anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others, that I need ſay little. Briefly, to diſcern Catholicks from the Manich'es occaſioned that Law. Chriſt his inſtitution in both kinds, (figured in <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeck's</hi> Oblation of Bread, and Wine, and not a perfect Sacrifice unleſs Prieſts do it in both) is a moſt weak Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to infer: Therefore the Layety is commanded to receive the Sacrament as Prieſts do in both. <hi>S. C.</hi> In his late excellent book againſt Doctor <hi>Pierce</hi> Chap. 12. demonſtrat's by the Teſtimonies of ancient Fathers, that Communion in one kind hath been in the moſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ages a practice among Chriſtians. Thus much only I'll ſay, and end; if Infants once received the Holy Euchariſt in one kind only: if men of riper Age did the like in time of perſecution: if what the Fathers aſſure us of Domeſtical Communion, and the like of <hi>Ermits</hi> keeping the Bleſſed Sacrament in their ſolitude, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Cup was not given but in the Church) be true: (and moſt true all is.) Finally, if our Bleſſed Lord af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Reſurrection gave his own Body (going to <hi>Emaus</hi>) to his Diſciples, as divers Fathers teſtifie without the Cup, and they had their eyes opened: let the Doctor once open his alſo, and confeſs ingeniouſly that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was in theſe caſes reputed effective, lawful, and laudible in one kind only. More I need not ſay, for its from my intent to handle this Controverſie at large: might I go on, I could tell him that ſeeing the Fruit of Proteſtant Communion is only to ſtir up Faith in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; I can find no reaſon why their bit of Bread on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107258:27"/> may not as well work that effect, as to taſte of their Wine with it. But enough of this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The Doctor in his <hi>7th.</hi> Section, pag. 50. cites againſt publick Prayer in in an unknown Language that ſo often diſcuſſed paſſage of the Apoſtle 1. <hi>ad corint.</hi> 14. It would be loſt labour to repeat here what our Learned Writers have with all clarity anſwered; <hi>I. S.</hi> in his ſhort Treatiſe againſt Doctor <hi>Pierce</hi> his Sermon, pag. 89. and 90. ſolidly ponders that text, and ſhewes it makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for Proteſtants. Next,</p>
            <p>He cites <hi>Origen lib. 8. contra Celſum</hi> without either page, or number, whereas that <hi>8th.</hi> book with me, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Baſil</hi> 1571. (and in a cloſs letter) hath ten whole leaves in <hi>Folio.</hi> However, the proof is nothing: The <hi>Graecians</hi> were to pray in Greek, the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Language; (both Sacred Tongues) what is this to the Doctors purpoſe?</p>
            <p>Page the 52. he cites St. <hi>Baſil lib. qu. ex ver. Scrip. locis q.</hi> 278. we have three Editions of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and the laſt both in Greek and Latin Printed at <hi>Paris</hi> in two Tomes, and in no one Catalogue of his works do I find that Treatiſe the Doctor points at <hi>lib. qu. ex.</hi> &amp;c. He would oblige me to direct me better to the Book. Next he cites St. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> in a long Homily without giving his words, and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in <hi>Pſ. 18. com.</hi> 2. (with me) it is <hi>Expoſ.</hi> 2. All I can find here to any purpoſe, are theſe words: <hi>Nos autem</hi> (ſaith the Saint) <hi>qui in Eccleſia divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na eloquia cantare didicimus, ſimul etiam inſtare debemus quod Scriptum eſt; Beatus populus qui intelligit jubilationem, proinde chariſſimi, quod conſona voce cantavimus, ſereno etiam cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de noſſe, &amp; videre debemus. We who have Learned to ſing the Divine Words</hi> (or <hi>Pſalms) in Church, muſt alſo be earneſt to follow what is written. Bleſſed are
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107258:28"/> they who understand Iubilation. Therefore, my deareſt, what we ſing out with one voice, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour we muſt to know and ſee with a ſerene heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, who are theſe <hi>We?</hi> Prieſts, and the Clergy that underſtood Latin, yet perhaps penetrated not the deep and latent ſence of thoſe Sacred Canticles. This ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin, We are to be inſtant in, and not only to ſing the words, but to know with a ſerene heart,</hi> &amp;c. I believe moſt of the Miniſters, though they ſay, and ſing theſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> in Engliſh, are yet to ſeek for the very literal ſence of them: good Counſel 'tis that all according to their capacity learn by an Interpreter, or otherwiſe ſomewhat of it; yes, and of the Myſtery alſo. But to infer from hence: <hi>Ergo,</hi> theſe ſacred words muſt be read in a vulgar Tongue in time of Church Service, is no conſequence at all: though let me tell you, things well conſidered, the <hi>Greek</hi> reſpectively to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> to the <hi>Weſt,</hi> may be better called a known Tongue, (though not vulgar) then particular Languages of ſeveral Nations. <hi>Spain, France, England, Germany, Poland,</hi> &amp;c. in the generality know <hi>Latin.</hi> But doth the <hi>Spaniard</hi> know French, or other People <hi>Dutch,</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Language? not one among many.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, pag. 54. rightly cites (which is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) the words of the great Council of <hi>Lateran, ſub Innocentio 3. cap.</hi> 9. but proves nothing with them. Firſt, becauſe the Several Rights and Languages there mentioned, cannot be ſhewed to be different from <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and in uſe <hi>among thoſe who have one and the ſame Faith.</hi> 2. Admit they were different, the Church can upon weighty reaſons diſpenſe in her Law with Children of one and the ſame belief; at moſt then, here was a diſpenſation, which both ſuppoſeth,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107258:28"/> and confirms the received Law. I ſay <hi>at moſt;</hi> for I read in <hi>Binius</hi> his Notes upon this Council, pag. 699. <hi>prim â columnâ, Fine;</hi> that the Patriark of the <hi>Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> who had abjured his Hereſie of the <hi>Monothelits,</hi> came to this great Council, ſubmitted himſelf, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Catholick Faith, and believed as thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aſſembled did, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to him and his might well be granted the uſe of their Rights, and Lithurgy while their belief was one, and Catholick. Now let the Doctor tell me what Language the <hi>Maronits</hi> then uſed in their Lithurgy; if <hi>Syriack?</hi> it was Sacred, and ſpoken by our Saviour.

Well, for the Veneration of Images, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the definition of a General Council: (the Second at <hi>Nice</hi>) we have endleſs Authorities. I'll produce a few manifeſt ones which the Doctor ſhall never anſwer. St. <hi>Baſil</hi> the Great in his Epiſtle 205. <hi>ad Iulianum</hi> (read it in the ſecond Tome of his works, Printed <hi>anno</hi> 1618 at <hi>Paris,</hi> pag. 993.) hath theſe unanſwerable words: <hi>Suſcipio autem, &amp; ſanctos Apoſtolos, Prophetas, &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, &amp; ad ſupplicationem, quae eſt ad Deum, hos invoco, ut per eos, id eſt, per interventionem eorum propitius mihi ſit mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſericors Deus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I willingly admit of the Holy Prophets, oft he Apoſtles, and Martyrs, and in my Prayer made to God call upon them, that by their interceſſion, God may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious and merciful to me,</hi> &amp;c. He goes on thus: <hi>Unde &amp; Figuras imaginum eorum <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 span">

VVhereupon I honour, and adore the Portracture or Figure of their Images; chiefly when this adoration is delivered to us by the Apoſtles, and no where forbidden; but is manifeſtly ſhewed us in all our Churches.</hi> What can be clearer? Now if you'll know how this Great Saint adored thoſe Images, none can tell you better then St. <hi>Iohn Damaſcen, lib. 4. Orthod. fidei cap.</hi> 17. ſoon after the beginning of that Chapter: <hi>Nam ut ille magna re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum divinarum eruditione praeditus Baſilius ait, imaginis honor exemplum tranſit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For as that Great Maſter St.</hi> Baſil, <hi>highly endewed with the knowledge of Divine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, tell's us, The honour given to Images paſſeth to the Prototype. Bellar.</hi> in his Appendix <hi>de cultu imaginum, cap. 4. § paulo poſt,</hi> hath this Authority of St. <hi>Baſil;</hi> but, as you may ſee, of another Edition, which makes it ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable.

            </p>
            <p>The third is out of St. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> in <hi>Liturgia,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret: <hi>Eraſmo.

The fourth is out of St. <hi>Gregory, lib. 7. Epiſt. 54. ad ſecundinum.

            </p>
            <p>The laſt is St. <hi>Iohn Damaſcen's, lib. 4. Orthodoxae fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei cap. 17. Quoniam nonnulli</hi> (ſaith the Saint) <hi>eo nomine nos reprehendunt, quod ſalvatoris, ac Dominae noſtrae reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorumque ſanctorum, ac Chriſti ſervorum imagines adoramus, atque honore afficimus; audiant velim quod Deus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Becauſe ſome upon this account reprehend us that we adore, and honour the Images of Chriſt, of our Lady, of other Saints, and ſervants of Chriſt. I would have them know that God from the beginning made man to his own likeneſs; from whence is it then that we worſhip one another, but that we are made to Gods likeneſs?</hi> Next the Saint diſcourſeth about the uſe of Images amongſt Chriſtians; and finally concludes thus: <hi>Siquidem perſaepe uſu venit, ut domini paſſionem ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo minimè verſantes, conſpectâ Chriſti crucifixi imagine in ſalutiferae paſſionis memoriam redeamus, ac proſtrati, non materiam, ſed eum, cujus imago effingitur, adoramus. For it often comes to paſs, that when we are leaſt thinking of our Lords paſſion, by ſeeing the Image of him crucified we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Sacred Paſſion, and proſtrat adore, (not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Image, but) him whoſe Picture is there drawn out.</hi> Thus St. <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> who with the other Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers now cited delivers moſt Catholick Doctrine. I could wiſh the Doctor would teach his <hi>people</hi> to anſwer this one only Authority, and that of St. <hi>Baſil.</hi> In the interim let us ſee what our Doctor hath againſt I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, and their Veneration. We find, ſaith he, page 57. Images brought into Chriſtian Religion by <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> where I beſeech you? the Doctor cites <hi>Theod. lib. 1. Haereticarum fabularum.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin de hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſibus,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107258:31"/> reſibus,</hi> and St. <hi>Irenaeus, lib. 1. cap. 23. Anſw. Theodoret</hi> hath nothing like it, either under the Title <hi>de Simone,</hi> Or <hi>Carpocrate.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> relates at large <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his Hereſie in that book <hi>de haeres: ad quod vult Deus,</hi> but not a ſyllable is there that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> firſt brought Images into Chriſtian Religion. St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in that book and Chapter now cited under this Title: <hi>Quae eſt ſaturnini argumentatio:</hi> Relating how <hi>Baſilides</hi> held the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten <hi>Nun</hi> to be Chriſt, hath theſe words: <hi>Qua propter neque paſſum eum ſed Simonem quendam Cyrenaeum angariatum portaſſe crucem ejus pro e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> Wherefore, he ſaid, that Chriſt fuffered not, but <hi>Simon Cyrenaeus</hi> for him who was forc'd to carry his Croſs: But not a word of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his being Author of Images in that whole Chapter. <hi>Simon Cyrenaeus</hi> was a different man from <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus. Well,</hi> ſaith the Doctor, pag. 58. <hi>theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tell us that the</hi> Gnoſticks, <hi>or</hi> Carpocratians <hi>did make Images, and ſaid that the form of Chriſt as he was made in the fleſh, was made by</hi> Pilate; <hi>and theſe Images they worſhip'd as did the</hi> Gentiles. My God! what ſtuff is here? <hi>Carpocrates,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin, who held that Chriſt was man only, worſhiped the Images of Ieſus,</hi> Paul, <hi>of</hi> Homer, <hi>and</hi> Pythagoras (theſe the Doctor omits.) <hi>The Gnoſticks,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> (not in his 23. but 24. Chapter) <hi>had ſome Pictures Painted, others of other matter, Dicentes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam Chriſti factam a Pilato illo in tempore quo fuit Ieſus cum hominibus, &amp; has coronant, &amp; proponunt eas cum imagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus mundi Phyloſophorum,</hi> viz. <hi>cum imagine Pythagorae, &amp; Platonis, &amp; Ariſtotelis, &amp; reliquorum, &amp; reliquam obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationem circa eas ſimiliter, ut gentes faciunt. Saying the form of Chriſt was made by</hi> Pilate <hi>when Ieſus converſed with men; theſe they crown'd, and ſet out to ſhew with the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of worldly Phyloſophers,</hi> Pythagoras, Plato, Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>and the reſt, and honoured them juſt as the</hi> Gentiles <hi>did,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:107258:31"/>
            <p>The Fathers here are exactly cited by me. And what is it that the Doctor concludes? Obſerve well: Theſe Hereticks Worſhiped the Picture of Chriſt with ſuch an Homage as the Gentiles did their Idols; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Catholicks may not honor the Image of Chriſt, and his Saints with Relation to the <hi>Prototypes,</hi> and not after that manner the Gentils did their Idols, leaving out the Pictures of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Aristole.</hi> Is this a good Concluſion? Had he given you faithfully the Fathers Words expreſly mentioning the Images of the Ancient Phyloſophers, the Reader would have ſeen the weakneſs of his Argument: But what will you? to make Images odious, Juggle he muſt, and conceal what is againſt him. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> cited relates the Hereſie of the <hi>Carpocratites</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> doth, only he adds: <hi>Habent eas imagines occultè, inſuperque Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophorum, Pythagorae, Platonis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cum quibus Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophis, etiam alias imagines Ieſu collocant, collocataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que adorant, &amp; gentium misteria perficiunt. They have theſe Images privately; and moreover, the Phyloſophers Pictures, theſe with other Images of Ieſus they place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and adore, and do the Gentils Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi>

Yea, but <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> ſaith, <hi>We have no Image in the World, it is apparently forbidden to exerciſe that deceitful Art, for it is written, Thou ſhalt not make any ſimilitude of any thing in Heaven above.</hi> Strange it is that <hi>Clemens</hi> ſpeaks ſo; certainly there are Pictures in the World, and as I have heard, a Crucifix in many Proteſtant Churches. Certainly the Art of Painting is not forbidden in <hi>England</hi> as a deceitful Art; for if one ſhould Paint the Sun, or Stars above in Heaven, is this prohibited? where then doth <hi>Clemens Alexand.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver this Doctrine? <hi>lib. 6.

            <p>He cites next <hi>Origen lib. 7. &amp; 8. contra Celſum</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either page, or number, or his words; yet theſe two Books <hi>Baſil</hi> Print 1571. contain 40. pages in <hi>Folio.</hi> In a word, <hi>Origen</hi> hath nothing againſt the uſe of Images, but wholly impugns the gods of the Gentils, their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ſemblances, their Idols; and declares our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine thus: <hi>lib. 7. contra Celſum num.</hi> 18. page (with me) 789. <hi>Nos vero ideo quoque non honoramus ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulacra, quia quantum poſſumus cavemus, ne quo modo inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus in eam credulitatem, ut his tribuamus divinitatis ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid.

            <p>The Doctor, pag. 59. brings that often anſwered ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection out of the Council <hi>Elibery,</hi> that pictures might not be in Churches. <hi>Ne quod colitur, aut adoratur in parietibus depingatur.

            <p>The Doctor in the ſame page hath three places out of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to no purpoſe. The firſt is <hi>de moribus Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae lib. 1. cap.</hi> 34. where he ſpeaking to the <hi>Manichees,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:107258:34"/> ſaith, <hi>Novi multos eſſe &amp; Sepulchorum, &amp; Pictura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum adoratores,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I know many honouring Sepulchers and Pictures; yet in life reprehenſible.</hi> The ſecond <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, &amp; ſymbolo, cap.</hi> 7. where he ſaith, and truly, that God cannot be circumſcribed in any humane form; and then adds <hi>Tale enim Simulacrum Dei, neſas Christiano in templo collocare. 'Tis wickedneſs in a Chriſtian to place ſuch a vain Figure (of God circumſcribed) in a Church.</hi> The third is <hi>contra Adimantum cap.</hi> 13. where he forbids <hi>cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſimulacrorum,</hi> which God prohibited in the old Law. What is here for the Doctor? who next hath a fling at the ſeventh Synod, or ſecond Council of <hi>Nice; Whoſe Acts about the worſhiping of Images were reproved by the Council of</hi> Francfurt. An old, old ſtory anſwered a hundred times over. Let it paſs: yet I muſt not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſay a word of what he hath, pag. 58. out of St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Epiſtle to <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> becauſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants urge it much. The ſtory, which you may read in the very end of that Epiſtle is briefly thus: <hi>Praeterea quod audivi, quoſdam murmurare contra me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that I heard ſome murmur againſt me; becauſe when we paſſed to the holy place which is called</hi> Bethel [<hi>the Doctor calls it the Village of</hi> Bethel, <hi>for fear [I think] of naming a holy place] that there I might make a collect, according to the cuſtom of the Church, Et veniſſem ad villam, quae vocatur, and came to the Village called</hi> Anablatha: <hi>and paſſing by, had ſeen a Lamp burning, asking what the place was, and underſtanding it was a Church, and entring to Pray. Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni ibi velum pendens in foribus Eccleſiae, tinctum, atque depictum, &amp; habens imaginem quaſi Chriſti, aut ſancti cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſdam. I found there in the entry of the Church,</hi> (no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent place, but the Doctor conceals this) <hi>a Veil hanging, dyed and painted, having an Image as it were of Chriſt, or ſome Saint,</hi> for ſaith St. <hi>Epiphanius, I do not remember
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107258:34"/> whoſe Picture it was: when I had ſeen this,</hi> viz. <hi>the Picture of a man hanging in the Church contrary to the Authority of Scripture I cut it in pieces, and gave Counſel to thoſe who kept the place, that ſome poor man ſhould be buried in that Veil.</hi> Here is the ſtory; that which follows adds no new light to it for the Doctor. Now if all this were true, what makes it for the Doctors purpoſe? St <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> cut in pieces a cloth Picture, the Image was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him, whether of Chriſt or no, perhaps it was of ſome prophane man who was there honoured for Chriſt, or a Saint; <hi>therefore,</hi> St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> judged that the undoubted Picture of Chriſt, and his Saints cannot be in Churches: No conſequence at all. But in a word, the ſtory is ſuppoſititious, and added to the Letter, as <hi>Bellar.</hi> Learnedly ſhews, <hi>lib. 2. de Imag. 9. §. ad quintum.</hi> Firſt, becauſe <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Epiſtles clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ends with theſe words: <hi>Deus autem pacis praeſtet nobis juxta ſuam clementiam ut conteratur ſatanas,</hi> &amp;c. Then follows <hi>Praeterea audivi</hi> ſo harſhly and<note place="margin">Either this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is true, or falſe: If true, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in <hi>England,</hi> for they have Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſixes in their Churches; if falſe it is not to the purpoſe.</note> diſ-joynedly that one with half an eye might ſee the want of order in it. 2. Becauſe thoſe Haereticks, who withſtood ſo induſtriouſly the uſe of Images in the ſeventh Synod, or <hi>2d.

Becauſe <hi>Epiphanius Diaconus</hi> demonſtrated in that <hi>7th,</hi> Synod, that two other Teſtimonies were falſly ſhufled into St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Works by Hereticks: Add 4. that St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and others who lived with <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> had Images in their Churches, and reverenced them. Thus <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> and he hath yet more on this ſubject.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107258:35"/> The Doctor in his <hi>9th.</hi> Section, page 61. fiercely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the Picturing of God the Father, and the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Trinity: And liberal he is with the Fathers. He gives you a whole liſt of them in his Margent, but not their words, and he does wiſely; for their words would have taught the Reader how little they make for him: though I muſt tell you, that it is not ſo certain that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges may be made of God and the Sacred Trinity, as of Chriſt, and his Saints; ſome Catholick Doctors diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the firſt, ſaying it is only tolerated by the Church, not approved: None the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Well, one Principle of St. <hi>Iohn Damaſcen lib. 4. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox. fidei. cap.</hi> 17. (and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> points at the ſame <hi>de fide &amp; ſymbolo cap.</hi> 7.) ſolves all the Doctor hath, or can alledge in this matter. <hi>Quiſnam eſt</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen) qui inviſibilis, &amp; corpore vacantis, ac circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptionis, &amp; Figurae expertis, Dei Simulacrum effingere queat? extremae itaque dementiae atque impietatis fuerit, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum numen fingere, &amp; figurare. Who is there that can make an Effigies of, or Paint out the likeneſs of God, inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without any body, without Circumſcription (that is immens) and Figure at all? Madneſs it is thus to figure a Detty, or a Divine Power.</hi> As who ſhould ſay: He that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to expreſs by any Image the perfect Similitude of Gods intrinſecal Perfections, or his Nature which (is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens) without body or figure, would be both impious, and act the part of a mad man; Yes, and as <hi>Bellar.</hi> obſerves <hi>lib. 2. de imag. cap. 8. § proſolutione,</hi> would make a very I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol. Such picturing of God, the Fathers now cited reprove; but if God, or an Angel appear in the form of a man, as he did walking in Paradiſe: why may not thoſe viſible, and circumſcribed Lineaments, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to our eyes? He was no Idol walking in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, neither is he one Painted in Paper.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107258:35"/> The Doctor pag. 62. after the Fathers, cites <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius lib. 1. de ſomno Scipionis cap.</hi> 2. The exact words of <hi>Macrobius</hi> are theſe: (after he had declared, what a powerful <hi>Being</hi> God is: <hi>Quod ſciri quale ſit ab homine non poſſit:</hi> that it cannot be known by man of what Nature he is.) <hi>Ideo, &amp; nullum ejus ſimulacrum quod cum Dis aliis conſtitueretur finxit antiquitas. And therefore Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity never made any ſemblance of him that might be placed with other of their Gods:</hi> Exactly the ſame that St. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen,</hi> and other Fathers ſay. Next he cites <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus Calixtus lib. 18. cap.</hi> 53. where delating the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the <hi>Iacobits,</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> the Doctor ſaith, <hi>They made Images of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, which is abſurd.</hi> Hold there good Doctor, you name one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more then <hi>Nicephorus</hi> doth: <hi>Imagines</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Patris, &amp; ſpiritus Sancti effigiant, quod perquam eſt abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum. They made Pictures of the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, which is very abſurd.</hi> And pray you, is it not abſurd to Picture the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt without the Son? Well, I anſwer: To Paint their incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Divinity is moſt blameable; but not to Picture their viſible apparitions: neither doth <hi>Nicephorus</hi> affirm it, nay he ſaith four lines after: <hi>Imagines ſacras hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant illi quidam, ſed non oſculantur. Theſe Hereticks wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped holy Images,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> he held ſome Pictures Holy and Sacred, but this the Doctor mentioneth not; yet ſhuts up his Sect. pag. 63. with a weighty ſentence of <hi>Polidor Virgil, lib. 2. de inventione rerum, cap.</hi> 23. His words are theſe in the beginning of the Chapter, <hi>Quo fit, ut cum Deus ubique praeſens ſit, nihil a principio poſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines natos ſtultius viſum ſit quam ejus ſimulacrum fia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere.

            </argument>
            <p>THe Doctor pag. 63. Sect. 10. enters upon a large debated controverſie, the Popes Authority, and thinks with his four leaves, and a few old defeated objections to undo both Pope and Popery. He tells us firſt, <hi>When Chriſt founded his Church he left it in the hands of his Apoſtles without any Praerogative given to one above the reſt, ſave only of Priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and orderly precedency, which of it ſelf was natural, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and incident.</hi> I would gladly know of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in plain Engliſh, what theſe minced words of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority,</hi> and <hi>orderly Precedency</hi> ſignifie? or what could that one Apoſtle, (let it be St. <hi>Peter,</hi> if he pleaſe) do more by force of this <hi>Priority,</hi> and <hi>orderly Precedency</hi> then St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any of the Apoſtles? St. <hi>Peter</hi> writ Canonical Scripture, ſo did St. <hi>Paul;</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> governed the whole Church, and had juriſdiction over it, ſo
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107258:36"/> (ſaith the Doctor) had St. <hi>Paul;</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> could make Laws for the Univerſal Church, and was St. <hi>Paul</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in this Power? what then ſignifies this Priority, and orderly Precedency in one above the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? Let him declare this ingeniouſly, bring it to a reality, and prove it (as it behoveth him) by Scripture, and that very Place he cites ſhall prove alſo that <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> which Catholicks give to St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the interim be pleaſed to hear how pag. 64. he quotes St. <hi>Cyprian deunit: Eccle.</hi> for equality of Power among the Apoſtles, and deceives his Reader by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing part, and depraving the whole ſence of St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> words: They are long and thus. <hi>Loquitur Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ad Petrum. Ego dico tibi quia tu es Petrus, &amp; ſuper iſtam petram aedificabo Eccleſiam meam, &amp; portae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; tibi dabo claves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; iterum eidem, poſt reſurrectionem ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am dicit, paſce oves meas.

Et quamvis Apoſtolis omnibus poſt Reſurrectionem ſuam parem poteſtatem tribuat, &amp; dicat, ſicut miſit me Pater, &amp; ego mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vos,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tamen ut unitatem manifeſtaret, unam Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dram conſtituit, &amp; unitatis ejuſdam originem ab uno incipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entem ſua Authoritate diſpoſuit. Our Lord ſpake unto</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>I ſay unto thee that thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And again, after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, he ſaid unto him, Feed my Sheep: Upon him one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or only, he builds his Church, to him he committed his Flock to be fed. And although he gave after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection equal power to all the Apoſtles, and ſaid, As my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent me, I ſend you; yet to manifeſt Unity, he appointed or ſetled one Chair, and the Origen of this Unity he ordered by his own Authority to proceed from one.</hi> (Now follows the Doctors words) <hi>Hoc erant utique &amp; caeteri Apoſtoli quod fuit Petrus, pariconſortio praediti &amp; honoris &amp; poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107258:37"/> ſed exordium ab unitate proficiſcitur. Primatus Petro datur, ut una Chriſti Eccleſia, &amp; Cathedra una monſtretur. What</hi> Peter <hi>was the other Apoſtles were, endowed with like fellowſhip of Honour and Power, but the beginning comes from Unity. The Primacy is given to</hi> Peter, <hi>that one Church of Chriſt and one Apoſtolical Chair might be manifeſt.</hi> Theſe laſt words, <hi>ſed exordium,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Primatus Petro datur,</hi> and <hi>ſuper illum unum,</hi> as alſo the precedent, <hi>unam Cathedram conſtituit,</hi> which clear all, the Doctor conceals. Is not here plain jugling?</p>
            <p>This Primacy, and true Head-ſhip of St. <hi>Peter</hi> all Antiquity ſo amply confirms, that Volumes might be made of their Writings. See that Learned and ancient Author <hi>Optatus milevitanus, lib. 2. adverſus Parmenianum,</hi> page (with me in his works printed at <hi>Paris 1631) 48. Igitur negare non potes, ſcire te in urbe Roma Petro primam Cathedram Epiſcopalem eſſe collocatam, in qua ſederit omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Apoſtolorum caput Petrus: unde &amp; Cephas appellatus est, in qua una Cathedrâ unit as ab omnibus ſervaretur, ne caeteri Apostoli ſingulas, ſibi quiſque defenderet: ut jam ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus &amp; peccator eſſet, qui contra ſingularem Cathedram, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teram collocaret: Ergo, Cathedra una eſt, quae est prima de dotibus. ſedit prior Petrus, cui ſucceſſit Linus, Lino ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſit Clemens, Clementi, Anacletus,</hi> &amp;c. The ſence is. <hi>Deny you can not, that you know, that the first Biſhops Seat was placed at</hi> Rome, <hi>where</hi> Peter <hi>the head of all the Apostles did ſit, and therefore was called</hi> Cephas. <hi>This was done to prevent, least any ſhould erect another Chair against it. The Seat therefore is one, the first of Gifts and Graces: firſt ſate</hi> Peter, Linus <hi>ſucceeded,</hi> &amp;c. And he gives you a Liſt of the other enſuing Popes to <hi>Siricius,</hi> who ſate in this Chair when <hi>Optatus</hi> lived.

For</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>whom our Saviour firſt made choice of, and upon whom he built his Church; did not inſolently vindicate himſelf when</hi> Paul <hi>diſputed with him concerning Circumciſion, or proudly ſaid? that he was ſuperior or held the Primacy,</hi> &amp;c. Endleſs ſhould I be, if I held on with ſuch manifeſt Authorities for St. <hi>Peters</hi> Primacy, and Superiority e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over the Apoſtles. If you would have more? <hi>Ballarm.</hi> largely furniſheth you; but none me thinks goes beyond a book Printed at <hi>Paris, anno</hi> 1553. the Author is a Lawyer <hi>Remundus Rufus</hi> a moſt Eloquent, Solid, and Learned man that writ againſt <hi>Molinaeus,</hi> and ſo pithily defends the Popes Authority, and ſolves
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107258:38"/> all Arguments againſt it; that I verily perſwade my ſelf, had the Doctor read him, he would never have troubled the World with his four forceleſs leaves againſt either Pope, or <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My task is now to ſolve thoſe words of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which the Doctor hath, pag. 64. <hi>The other Apoſtles were the ſame that St.</hi> Peter <hi>was,</hi> &amp;c. add to them St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms: Ex aequo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>One obvious and known diſtinction clears all; diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh then, <hi>inter Apoſtolatum, &amp; Primatum,</hi> between Apoſtles-ſhip and Primacy, and whatever the Doctor hath, or can alledge falls to nothing. The Apoſtles therefore were all equal in the Dignity, and Office of their Apoſtles-ſhip, or to ſpeak with ſome Divines, <hi>quoad clavem Doctrinae:</hi> this is moſt true, and granted: But that they were all equal in Goverment, in Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, and Primacy ſhall never be proved, ſo long as thoſe words ſtand in the Goſpel. <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You will ask, where I have this diſtinction of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles-ſhip</hi> and <hi>Primacy.</hi> I <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt out of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and St. <hi>Hierom</hi> now cited: <hi>Hoc erant utique</hi> (ſaith the firſt) <hi>caeteri Apoſtoli, quod fuit Petrus pari conſortio prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti,</hi> That is equal in this fellowſhip and office of being Apoſtles: <hi>Sed Primatus Petro datur: But the Primacy is given to</hi> Peter. Where you ſee, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> clearly grants an equality common to the whole Colledge of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and withal eſtabliſheth a Superiority proper to St. <hi>Peter</hi> only; either the words of this Saint are ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or the diſtinction of equality in many, and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in one muſt ſtand. And</p>
            <p>In this ſence St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> Doctrine is moſt ſignificant, without gloſs, or wreſting one ſyllable: <hi>Ex aequo ſuper eos,</hi> &amp;c. The ſtrength of the <hi>Church was equally built
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107258:38"/> upon the Apoſtles,</hi> viz. as Maſters, as Doctors, and Teachers illuminated by the Holy Ghoſt; yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore among twelve <hi>One was choſen that a Head or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being conſtituted, all occaſion of ſchiſm might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</hi> Here is certainly more then that Dimunitive <hi>orderly Precedency,</hi> our Doctor allows good St. <hi>Peter: Ut ſchiſmatis tollatur occaſio</hi> are ſignificant words, and point at what is moſt eſſential to the Church: The U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of it. See the abſolute neceſſity of this Head in order to Unity moſt ſolidly laid out by <hi>S. G.</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well what I was to ſhew, that St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth an equality amongſt many, and a Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in One. Once more I repeat it: equality relates to their Apoſtolical dignity, Supremacy to the Head and Governour.</p>
            <p>2. I draw this diſtinction of Apoſtles-ſhip in All, and Head-ſhip in One, from St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, <hi>lib. 2. Epiſt. 38. indictione</hi> 13. (ſo it is with me in his works printed at <hi>Antwerp anno</hi> 1572.) though others cite <hi>lib. 4. Certe</hi> (ſaith the Saint) <hi>Petrus Apoſtolus primum membrum ſanctae &amp; Univerſalis Eccleſiae eſt. Paulus, Ioannes, Andreas, quid aliud quam ſingularium ſant capita? &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſub uno capite omnes membra ſunt Eccleſiae. St.</hi> Peter <hi>is the firſt Member of the Univerſal Church, the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles not ſo, nor in like manner Univerſal.</hi> Yet with this Supremacy in <hi>Peter</hi> our Opponent muſt acknowledge an equality of their Apoſtle-ſhip.</p>
            <p>I will add one word more, and tell you though the Doctor ſhould alledge out of ſome Fathers that St. <hi>Paul</hi> may be rightly ſtiled the Head of Nations, and be ſaid to have had a Principality over the Church, yet the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between him and St. <hi>Peter</hi> is moſt remarkable. St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles, had this Principality as Legats by <hi>extraordinary conceſſion.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> had it over
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107258:39"/> the whole Church <hi>in ſolidum,</hi> yes, over the Apoſtles themſelves, as Paſtor Ordinary. I ſay <hi>Over the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves:</hi> ſo <hi>Anacletus</hi> Scholler to St. <hi>Prter</hi> cited by <hi>Remumdus Rufus</hi> in <hi>Molinaeum</hi> pag. 86. <hi>Inter beatos Apoſtolos</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>fuit quaedam diſcretio, &amp; licet omnes eſſent Apoſtoli Petro tamen a Domino est conſeſſum, &amp; ipſi inter ſe voluerunt id ipſum, ut reliquis praeeſſet Apoſtolis, &amp; Cephas, id est; caput &amp; principium teneret Apoſtolatus. There was a difference a diſtinction among the Bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and although all were Apoſtles, yet our Lord gave to</hi> Peter, <hi>and the other Apoſtles among themſelves will'd the ſame thing that</hi> Peter <hi>ſhould be Superiour to the rest, and</hi> Cephas, <hi>that is Head and chief of Apoſtleſhip.</hi>

               </gap> of to wonder at the bold aſſertion of our Doctor: pag. 65. <hi>viz. That by the Law of Christ one Biſhop is not Superiour to another: Christ gave the Power to all alike, he made no Head of the Biſhops, he gave to none a Supremacy of Power,</hi> &amp;c. So the Doctor,</p>
            <p>In the ſame pag. 65. he fills his Margent with a cluſter of Authors, but to what purpoſe God only knows; if they be to prove that Apoſtolical power is, and ſhall be ever in the Church: We grant it to the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> If to prove that Biſhops ſucceed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in all priviledges, and ample power they had in the Church; not one Father in the Doctors Margent aſſerts it; though in a real ſence, Biſhops that have a true miſſion may be called the Apoſtles ſucceſſors, by reaſon of their duty which is, to uphold the Doctrine of Chriſt taught by the Apoſtles, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſpiritual power, and Princely, and Prieſtly Dignity; and this is all St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith in the place cited by the Doctor, <hi>lib. 4. cap. 43. Quapropter eis qui
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107258:39"/> in Eccleſia ſunt Praesbiteris obaudire oportet, his, qui ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem habent ab Apoſtolis. Wherefore we ought to obey thoſe, who are Prieſts in the Church, thoſe, who have ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and the other Fathers ſay no more.</p>
            <p>I ſee not to what purpoſe the Doctor cites thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul: We are Embaſſadors or Legats for Chriſt,</hi> unleſs it be to prove what I aſſerted above, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles, though Princes of the Church, were not Paſtors Ordinary, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> was? Leſs do I know, why the Preface of the Maſs (<hi>Quos operis tui vicari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os,</hi> &amp;c. is brought in: Paſtors they were, but all ſubordinate to St. <hi>Peter</hi> as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>In his pag. 66. he jerks the Jeſuits, Monks and Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, for defending the Popes Authority over Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. But frivolous ſtories are but weak Arguments, yet the beſt the Doctor hath at hand. Next he cites Pope <hi>Elutherius,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That Christ committed the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church to Biſhops.</hi> How good Doctor? That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Biſhop hath juriſdiction over the Univerſal Church? Tis very ſtrange! the Biſhop of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Connor</hi> will not pretend to ſuch a power. Chriſt indeed committed the Univerſal Church to Biſhops by parts, or portions, whereof the whole Church is made, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with ſubordination to one head, which prevents ſchiſm, and conſerves Unity.</p>
            <p>Page 67. he cites the famous words of St. <hi>Cyprian. The Church of Chriſt is one through the whole world, divided by him, into many members, and the Biſhoprick is but one,</hi> &amp;c. No hurt in this, which makes againſt the Doctor; for if the whole Church of Chriſt be rightly called <hi>one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick,</hi> there muſt be certainly one Head over ſo Vaſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107258:40"/> a Biſhoprick; no other can be but the Pope, who Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns in Eccleſiaſtical affaires. Other Biſhops have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a portion in the Flock.</p>

As in the Bleſſed Trinity, whoſe Power is one and individual, ſo their is one Priest-hood,</hi> (our Doctor reads <hi>one Biſhoprick) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst divers Biſhops;</hi> and thus he reads after he had thruſt in a Parentheſis of his own head, not in <hi>Symmachus</hi> his Letter. But the worſt is the inference he draws from <hi>Symmachus</hi> his words: <hi>They being ſpoken</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>againſt the invaſion of the Rights of the Church of</hi> Arles, <hi>by</hi> Anaſtaſius, <hi>do fully declare the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>had no Superiority by the Law of Chriſt over any Biſhop,</hi> &amp;c. A moſt weak diſcourſe! For admit <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> had leſs prudently dealt with the Church of <hi>Arles,</hi> in changing the Ancient Cuſtom, admit a confuſion enſued upon this change; doth it therefore follow that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had no Superiority over any Biſhop in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church? Both Prince and Prelate may, out of leſs fore-ſight, make a Law damnable to their people; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they have no Superiority over them, is but a wretched concluſion, made by a Doctor of Divinity; who, if he had read <hi>Symmachus</hi> his Letter (and long it is not) he might have found the Popes Superiority aſſerted thus: <hi>Relegentes ergo veterum antiſtitum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>dilectionem tuam enixiſſime commonemus, ut in ordinandis per ſingulas urbes, cana, ac reverenda ſervetur antiquitas, nec novella conſtitutio vetuſtae ſanctionis robur imminuat.

            <p>Next he cites <hi>Origen:</hi> God knows where, for he points to no place: Then he furniſheth you with Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> his Authority, and St. <hi>Hierom:</hi> The firſt ſaith he is, <hi>distinct. 97. cap duo ſunt.</hi> He miſtakes the place, it is <hi>diſtinctione</hi> 96. rightly cited thus: <hi>Decreti prima pars. distinct. 96. cap. 10.

I think my Lord of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Connor</hi> will not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualize himſelf with the Primative of <hi>England</hi> every way, though if he were a true Biſhop (as he is none) <hi>Gelaſius</hi> his words would be verified: <hi>Sublimitas Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palis nullis poterit comparationibus adaequari.

            <argument>
               <p>Of St. <hi>Gregory's</hi> refuſing the Title of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Biſhop. Of Fathers aſſerting the Pope to be Supream Paſtor. Of the Doctors faulty Quotations.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>NExt page 69. comes that ſo often anſwered objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, out of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> who becauſe <hi>Iohn Patriarck</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople, called himſelf Univerſal Biſhop, ſaid it was a proud, profane, Sacrilegious, Antichriſtian Title.</hi> And
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107258:41"/> it was ſo indeed in this Patriarck, who had no right to the Title, or thing either.</p>
            <p>To clear the difficulty, be pleaſed to know, that this word <hi>Univerſalis</hi> may have a triple ſence: Firſt, it may ſignifie <hi>Unum Solum ſingulare,</hi> one ſole ſingular, ſo we ſpeak uſually, <hi>Univerſalis Eccleſia, id eſt, una tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, extra quam non eſt ſalus. One Church only Univerſal, out of which is no Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whoſoever therefore aſſumes to himſelf the Title of Univerſal Biſhop in this ſence, importing that he is the ſole, only, and ſingular Patriarck, and that other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are no more but ſuffragans, or delegates, is both Sacrilegious and <hi>Antichriſtian:</hi> Sacrilegious becauſe (en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing to himſelf the ſole power) he robs his Brethren of their true dignity. <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> becauſe he oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who appointed Biſhops with their reſpective power and juriſdiction, to govern as ſpiritual Princes in the Church.</p>
            <p>Now, that the Patriarck of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> arrogated to himſelf ſuch an ample power, may be proved out of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> in that often cited Epiſtle to <hi>Mauritius. Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> (ſaith the Saint) <hi>eorum unquam hoc ſingularitatis vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabulum aſſumpſit, nec uti conſenſit. No one ever aſſum'd, or conſented to uſe that word of Singularity:</hi> (and mark the reaſon) <hi>Ne dum privatim uni aliquid daretur, honore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito privarentur univerſi. Leaſt whilſt ſomething is given to one privately, the General or Univerſal are depriv'd of their due honour.</hi> And a little before: <hi>Si igitur illud no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in ea Eccleſia ſibi quiſquam arripit, Univerſa Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, quod abſit, a ſtatu ſuo corruit, quando, qui appellaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Univerſalis, cadit. If therefore any one takes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that name in the Church, the Univerſal Church (which God forbid) muſt fall, when he that was call'd Univerſal, falls.</hi> More to this purpoſe you may ſee <hi>Apud Gratianum

Admit that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> did ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon the like Motives, doth it follow that he yeilds up his Supremacy? No, he aſſerts this Supremacy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over writing to <hi>Mauritius: Petro Apoſtolorum principi, cum totius Eccleſiae principatus committitur, &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Univerſalis Apoſtolus non vocatur; &amp; vir ſanctiſſimus, conſacerdos meus Ioannes, vocari Univerſalis Epiſcopus co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur. When the Principality of the Church was commited to</hi> Peter, <hi>chief of the Apoſtles, he was not called Univerſal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and</hi> John <hi>my fellow Prieſt, endeavours to be called univerſal Biſhop.</hi> Now the Saint ſaith, <hi>That he knows no Biſhop that is not ſubject to the Seat Apoſtolick.</hi> Now, <hi>That the Seat of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>is alſo ſubject to him.</hi> Now, <hi>That it is lawful for none to tranſgreſs the Laws of that Seat.

            <p>This truth ſuppoſed: let us ſee the force of the Doctors Argument, which muſt be this, or nothing. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> refuſed the Title of <hi>Univerſal Biſhop: Ergo,</hi> he denyed his <hi>Supremacy over the Church.</hi> In anſwer, I plainly deny the conſequence, and ſay, that the Saint, by refuſing a Title which might ſeem new to him, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107258:43"/> which his Predeceſſors had not by ſolemn Rite, or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, out of the motive of Humility, doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deny his Power and <hi>Supremacy</hi> over the Church, whereunto poſitively he laies claim ſo often. A <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality</hi> ſtands good, entire, and unſhaken, Though an innocent Title, harmleſly expreſing that Principality, be for ſome reaſon refus'd by him, who juſtly poſſeſſes the Principality. His Majeſty, <hi>King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second,</hi> is now abſolute <hi>Monarch</hi> and Soveraign over his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and is rightly ſtiled King of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. Put caſe that either <hi>Parliament</hi> or People, ſhould go about to inveſt him, with a New Title, and call him <hi>Emperour of England, Scotland, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> might not his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty refuſe this Title, (which neither adds to, nor demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes his regal Power) without denying his <hi>Soveraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</hi> This is our caſe in St. <hi>Gregory;</hi> who, as he never laid claim to be <hi>Sole Biſhop of the World,</hi> nor to any <hi>prophane Title,</hi> ſo he never left off to maintain his due of <hi>Spiritual Principality</hi> over the Church.</p>
            <p>Thus much is ſaid, in caſe it can be ſhewed that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> rejected the Title of <hi>Univerſal Biſhop in the laſt ſence,</hi> above mentioned: For by what I have yet read, he rejects it only in oppoſition to <hi>Iohn,</hi> or in that ſence, in which this ambitious Prelate laid claim to it.</p>

[20. May</hi> the Letter was dated.]</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Cuſanus</hi> ſpeaks not ſo abſolutely as the Doctor
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107258:45"/> makes him, for although he ſaid, <hi>Siper poſſibile, Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virenſis Archiepiſcopus per Eccleſiam congregatam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If poſſible the Arch-biſhop of</hi> Trevers <hi>were by the Church aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, choſen for Head and Governor, he would be more the ſucceſſor of</hi> Peter <hi>then the Roman Biſhop:</hi> Yet he adds this mitigation: <hi>Licet credendum ſit Romanum Pontificem, ſicut locum Petri, ita &amp; principatum nunquam perditurum. Although it is to be believed, that the Roman Biſhop, as he will never loſe the place of</hi> Peter, <hi>ſo he will never loſe his Principality.</hi> This the Doctor thought fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi> in the place cited by the Doctor, §. <hi>Sed forſan,</hi> ſtifly defends the Succeſſion of the <hi>Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> to St. <hi>Peter: Verba ipſa</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>tu es Petrus, &amp; ſuper hunc,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; paſce oves meas, palam demonſtrant illa ratione Eccleſiam, uſque ad poſtremum diem orbis duraturam, fundaſſe, ut Petri ſucceſſores, perinde ac Petrus ipſe, vice Chriſti fungerentur: atque adeo unuſquiſque eorum ſummum in Eccleſia faſtigium teneret. Thoſe words, Thou art</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>and feed my Sheep; evidently demonſtrate the Church founded in ſuch a manner to the end of the World, that the Succeſſors of</hi> Peter <hi>as well as</hi> Peter <hi>himſelf be in the place of Chriſt, and every one of them hold Supreme Authority in the Church of Chriſt.</hi> It is true §. <hi>Duo ergo</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>rem eſſe impendio decentiſſimam ut Romana ſedes Petri ſanguine decorata ſit ſedes ſucceſſorum Petri. It is moſt decent that the Roman See honoured with the blood of</hi> Peter, <hi>be the place of all the Succeſſors of</hi> Peter: And then adds: <hi>Hac non obſtante veritate, nulla profecto ex Evangelio prohibitio plane colligitur, quo minus poſſet Eccleſiae conſtitutione fieri ut E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopus ſedem ſuam ab urbe demutaret: Imo ut nullam ſibi particularem applicaret, cujus diceretur Antiſtes, ſed eſſet U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſalis mundi Epiſcopus cui omnes particulares ſubjiceren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Notwithſtanding this Truth, there is no clear Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107258:45"/> in the Goſpel, forbidding (if the Church appoint ſo) that the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>change his Seat, yes, and apply no other particular one to himſelf, of which he may be called Biſhop and yet</hi> he would be the Univerſal Biſhop of the World: <hi>to whom all particulars ought to be ſubject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See now how little the Doctor hath got out of theſe two Authors: <hi>Cuſanus</hi> ſaith, that if by any poſſibility the Biſhop of <hi>Trevers</hi> were by the Votes of the Church, Head of it; he would have Univerſal juriſdiction over the Church, as the Pope hath now; (for <hi>Cuſanus</hi> ever defended this ample Authority of the <hi>Pope.) Soto</hi> ſaith, that it is not <hi>plane, fully, clearly,</hi> forbid in the Goſpel, that the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> change his See, yet if he did ſo, he would be ſtill the <hi>Univerſal Biſhop of the World;</hi> to whom all were ſubject, even the Biſhop of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Connor.</hi> Now here is that which vexeth our Doctor, <hi>viz.</hi> that one man have ſuch an ample command, and Authority over all: Put caſe, <hi>Per impoſſibile,</hi> (ſay I) that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Trevers</hi> were elected <hi>Pope, (qua Trevirenſis</hi>) with the ſame ample Power and juriſdiction that the Pope e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had, and that the <hi>Roman Biſhop</hi> were laid aſide: our good Doctor would even then, ſtorm as much againſt <hi>Trevers</hi> Pope, as he now doth againſt the <hi>Roman.</hi> It is not, God knows, the place or perſon that he ſo furiouſly oppoſeth, but the Power and Dignity annexed, to what See ſoever. This gives him regret.</p>
            <p>Next he ſaith, <hi>It cannot be proved that the Biſhop of</hi> Rome. <hi>is Prince of the Church;</hi> And I think by his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal citation he directs me to <hi>Ioannes Driedo de dogm. lib. 4. cap.</hi> 3. This Chapter hath 13. or 14. Leaves in <hi>Folio,</hi> and three parts in it. The Doctor might well have quoted the part, had he ever read <hi>Driedo:</hi> But let that paſs.

               <p>Of the Doctors harſh Doctrine concerning ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentence after ſin. Of his miſtakes, and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Authors.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN his <hi>11th. Section,</hi> pag. 71. he hath little worth notice a croud of Controverſies you have, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially run over <hi>E. G.

            <p>Page 72. he cites the Cannon Law <hi>de conſecrat. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. c. peracta.</hi> where it is ſaid, that <hi>Conſecration fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, all are to Communicat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for ſo the Apoſtles appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>holds.</hi> Had the Doctor the Marginal gloſs upon this Chapter, he might have ſeen, that this Ancient Law is now no more in force, and this by the permiſſion of the Church, obliging only to Communicate once a year. O, but the Apoſtles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it: So they alſo appointed, <hi>Act. 15. v. 20. To abſtain a ſuffocatis, &amp; ſanguine, from ſtrangled meat and blood;</hi> Doth the Doctor comply with this precept? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very poſitive Law, even of the Apoſtles, had not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways force in after ages. I wonder he cites this Law
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107258:47"/> againſt us, while Proteſtants themſelves do not obſerve it: doth every one, that is preſent at ſervice, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate when the Miniſter makes his <hi>Caena?</hi> but what will you? there is neither Conſecration nor Communion. The reſt that follows in this Section is moſt empty ſtuff.</p>
            <p>Page 75. <hi>cap. 2. Sect.</hi> 1. he much reprehends Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctors, who teach <hi>that a ſinner is not bound pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to repent of his ſin, as ſoon as he hath committed it.</hi> He adds, pag. 76. <hi>Though the Church calls on ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent on Holy days, or at</hi> Eaſter; <hi>yet that by the Law of God, they are not tyed to ſo much, but only to repent in the danger or article of Death. (Mark the word only.</hi>) And for this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he cites the <hi>Famous Navar,</hi> in his <hi>Enchir,</hi> or <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, cap. 1. num. 31. Anſw.</hi> I ſee he never read <hi>Navar,</hi> for he neither gives you the Right number, nor his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine exactly; the number, with me in his Manual printed at <hi>Antwerp</hi> 1601. is, <hi>num.</hi> 27. The Doctrine thus, after <hi>Navar</hi> had declared that the other two affirmative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>confeſſion</hi> do not oblige under pain of a new ſin but in time of neceſſity: <hi>Ita,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>per conſequutionem, praeceptum affirmativum de ſe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendo, non obligat ſub paena novi peccati Lethalis niſi in arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo neceſſitatis; in illo vero ſic: quamobrem ad praedictam paenitudinem concipiendam tenebimur imminente articulo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis naturalis, vel violentae, vel adminiſtrandi, ſuſcipiendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que aliquod ſacramentum, imo etiam inſtante populi neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate aliqua grandi, cui abſque orationis fervore provideri non poſſet. So by conſequence, the affirmative praecept of converting one ſelf, doth not oblige under pain of a new mortal ſin but in time of neceſſity, and in that Article thus: wherfore bound we are to repent in the imminent Article of death natural or violent, or when we receive any Sacrament, or any danger, or great neceſſity preſſes on us, not to be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107258:47"/> but by ardent Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. Perhaps the Doctor will ſay, that theſe two laſt caſes of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or great neceſſity, <hi>Per accident,</hi> accidently oblige a ſinner to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. Be it ſo, yet <hi>Navar</hi> ſaith not ſo much, at leaſt he doth not ſay, that a ſinner is obliged <hi>only</hi> to repent in the hour of his death. It is one thing to oblige a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to repent, when he is ready to dye, and another to ſay, he is <hi>only</hi> then obliged. All ſinners are certainly bound to repent then, yet many great Divines add to this a further obligation, and affirm that, <hi>aliquoties in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> for ſome time in their life, this Obligation lies on them.</p>
            <p>I cannot but ſmile reading our Doctor, pag. 76. (whoſe whole aim is to ſhew out of our Authors, that repentance is never neceſſary but in the hour of death <hi>only</hi>) to ſee how unwarily he ſpeaks from his own purpoſe, while he makes <hi>Renaldus</hi> to ſay, <hi>that a ſinner is obliged to repent</hi> (which is undoubtedly true.) He cites him, <hi>Prax. Fori. Paen. lib. 5. cap. 2. Sect. 4. n.</hi> 23. In Engliſh thus: <hi>It is true, and the Opinion of all men, that the time in which a ſinner is bound by the commandment of God to be contrite for his ſins, is the imminent Article of natural or violent death.</hi> Let every ingenious Reader ponder theſe Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh words till Dooms-day, and ſay afterwards whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can force any other ſence out of them, but this aſcertained Truth only, that a ſinner at death is obliged to repent, but that he is then <hi>only</hi> obliged (which is to the purpoſe) ſhall never be proved.</p>
            <p>I'll deal ingeniouſly, and help the Doctor: <hi>Reginald</hi> ſeems to ſay more then what this Empty Engliſh Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſets down. His words are: <hi>Omnium communis, ſententia eſt, tempus in quo peccator conteri tenetur, (intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige per ſe, ſeu vi ſpecialis Praecepti de contritione a deo dati) eſſe imminentem articulum mortis naturalis, vel violentae.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107258:48"/> The common Opinion of all is, that the time wherein a ſinner is bound to repent, (underſtand Per ſe, or by force of a ſpecial command given by Almighty God of contrition) is the imminent Article of a natural or violent death.</hi> This Parentheſis (<hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellige Per ſe</hi>) which <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>I ſay it</hi> ſeems <hi>for I cannot aſſert that</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald <hi>plainly ſays ſo much.</hi>
               </note> ſeems excluſive of other ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts ſave only at death, and would moſt have been for advantage, the Doctor wiſely leaves out. However with it he ſhall never make his aſſertion good, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Reginald holds, a ſinner is not obliged to repent but only in the hour of death,</hi> and I ſpeak of an Obligation <hi>per ſe,</hi> not of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental caſes, as if one makes a vow to have contrition, or to come to the Sacraments, &amp;c. My reaſon is: that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be no ſpecial command, <hi>given by Almighty God</hi> for contrition, but only in that Article; yet, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Law of Nature, and the Charity, that a long invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſinner, owes to his own Soul, both may, and doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige him ſometimes in life to convert himſelf to his Maker by hearty repentance; whereof more hereafter. <hi>Reginaldus</hi> further obſerves, out of St. <hi>Auſtin, That he who lives thus impenitent, incurs not only the danger of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing anew, but deeply hazards his Salvation, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard,</hi> intrincical to the ſtate of ſuch an inveterate Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; calls loud upon him; yes, and obliges him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in life to repentance, or the Love of God. Had the Doctor conſidered the counſel given us in Scripture, <hi>Eccleſ. 5. Ne tardes converti ad Dominum, &amp; ne differas de die in diem: Do not delay this converſion,</hi> &amp;c. And how Zealouſly both Divines in Schools, and Preachers in their Pulpits inculcate this wholeſome Doctrine, and lay open the danger of delaying ſinners, He would never have blamed <hi>Reginald,</hi> who only rigoriouſly examins what men are obliged to, under mortal ſin; <hi>Ex vi ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialis praecepti de contritione a deo dati:</hi> where every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle is reſtrictive, and little warrants the Doctors
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107258:48"/> charge on him, in the general: <hi>No repentance but in the Article of death only.</hi> The Doctor cites other words of <hi>Reginald</hi> mangled, and weighed out of their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Let that paſs among leſſer faults.</p>
            <p>Now one word of his new Learning: He ſaith then pag. 76. <hi>that a ſinner ought to repent preſently after his ſin.</hi> I ask him whether he hath <hi>any precept</hi> for this aſſertion in Scripture, and mind him of his own Quotation: <hi>'Tis the part of a Deviliſh ſpirit to think any thing to be Divine, that is not Scripture.</hi> Here we may have plain dealing, if he pleaſe; Either he can give Scripture for a ſinners preſent repentence after ſin, or no; if he cannot, he hath a <hi>deviliſh ſpirit,</hi> impoſing on poor Souls a Divine command, not proved by Scripture; if he warrants this precept by Scripture, without gloſs, and interpretation of his own, I will proclaim to the whole World, that Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> is one of the moſt profound Divines we have now in <hi>Europe:</hi> But this he ſhall never do: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am afraid the other Lot will fall on him.</p>
            <p>I will be plain. Moſt harſh and an intolerable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it is to ſay, that a ſinner under new mortal ſin, is obliged to repent preſently, eſpecially in the Doctors Opinion, who makes no diſtinction between ſins mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and venial in their own Nature. Obſerve I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you: Put caſe that one commits a Murther this day, and continues in the ſin for Months and Years, it followeth evidently, that for every Moment of theſe Months and Years, (if he reflects on his Homicide) be ſins a new unleſs he repents: Why? <hi>The command of God is that he repent preſently after his Fact:</hi> This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he Tranſgreſſes, and therefore ſins a new; the next Moment, Hour, or day, the ſame ſevere Command of God (obliging to repentance) leaves him not, he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107258:49"/> ſins ſtill on, and conſequently, for as many Moments as he lives (let it be for Years) he heaps ſin upon ſin, and multiplies them without number: for the command of God obliging all this while to repentance, is grievi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly tranſgreſſed, and to tranſgreſs that Law, makes ſo often, with our Doctor, ſo many ſins. Is not here a <hi>ſad</hi> and deplorable <hi>ſtory,</hi> to uſe the Phraſe of our Doctor? Is it not much better to ſay with <hi>Reginald</hi> that it is a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer evil for a man to continue under one ſin for a time, (though ſuch a condition is deplorable) then to have ſins multiplyed hourly and daily, almoſt numberleſs? Now if the Negative precept, as <hi>Reginald</hi> holds, forbids not the perſeverance in ſin, (at leaſt for ſome time) theſe whole Troops of tranſgreſſions, which (according to the Doctor) intervene between the firſt ſin committed, and final repentance are avoided. Here is mercy to a poor ſinner. The Doctor mercileſly without Scripture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Authority at all, ſaith what God never ſpake, and drives him to deſparation.</p>
            <p>Page 77. he ſhews himſelf more then ſtrangely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: And firſt, I do not touch upon what he ſaith, <hi>That the Church hath been more ſevere then God, tying a ſinner by collateral poſitive Laws to repent at</hi> Eaſter; <hi>nor ſecondly, of the ſeeming contradiction, which follows, that the Church Ordains but the means, the exterior ſolemnity of it (that is confeſſion,</hi> &amp;c.) Theſe I wave, and wiſh the Reader to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the laſt words in that Paragraph: <hi>So that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are ſtill left to their liberties,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>even to ſatisfie our ſelves with all the remaining pleaſures of that ſin for a little while, even during our ſhort mortal Life: only we muſt be ſure to repent at laſt.</hi> Mark well, <hi>Even to ſatisfie our ſelves, with all the remaining pleaſures of that ſin for our mortal life.</hi> What! a Doctor of Divinity and ſpeak thus? why there is none but knows, that the taking of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107258:49"/> content, or ſatisfaction in the pleaſure of a ſin paſt, is another hidious ſin, forbidden by Almighty God, and execrated by all Doctors. A ſin once committed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains habitually, (miſery enough) until it be retracted by penance; but to take pleaſure in it afterwards, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother guilt diſtinct from the former, unto which it ſeems our Doctors Divinity reaches not.</p>

            <p>THe Doctor in his 78. pag. has nothing but talk without ſubſtance: In his 79. he excepts againſt our Doctrine of contrition, and ſaith we allow it not valuable, unleſs it includes a deſire, or will to confeſs our ſins to a Prieſt. <hi>Anſw.</hi> We do ſo, and give this reaſon: True contrition, which reconciles to God, votively at leaſt implies a will of doing what God Commands: But one Command is, that we confeſs our ſins to a Prieſt; therefore true Contrition ſubmits to it.

            <p>To confirme this diſcourſe, I have enough from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, pag. 79. who ſaith that <hi>Genuine and true Contrition is a Cordial ſorrow for having ſinned againſt God,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>Ending in a dereliction of all ſin, and a walking in all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> I wiſh no more; for this <hi>very walking in all Righteouſneſs,</hi> implies the obedience we give to Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and will make our good Doctor walk to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion alſo, if Scripture or Church have Ordained it for finners: perhaps he may ſay, that Confeſſion is only of Counſel, not of Command, when I have his Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for ſuch an aſſertion, he ſhall have his anſwer fully.</p>
            <p>In the interim, know, that it is but vain to talk (as our Doctor doth) of a repentance <hi>towards God,</hi> (as it were <hi>in abſtracto</hi>) without deſcending to the ultimate
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107258:50"/> worth and Efficacy of it, which as now I ſaid includes a ſerious will of doing Gods Command. This truth ſuppoſed, with what conſcience can the Doctor ſay that we prefer repentance <hi>towards</hi> men, before that which the Scripture calls repentance <hi>towards</hi> God? It is a flat Calumny, and as ill intended, as expreſſed improperly; for in this Sacrament there is Confeſſion to a man, but what repentance is there <hi>towards men</hi> that we prefer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Noble Act of Contrition, which reſting in God, prefers him and his Commands, before all things in the World?</p>
            <p>A few lines after he ſaith, pag. 80. <hi>As Contrition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Ritual and Sacramental Confeſſion will not reconcile us to God; ſo Attrition with their Sacrament will reconcile the ſinner: Contrition without it will not: Attrition with it will reconcile us. And this Doctrine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is expreſly Decreed at</hi> Trent.</p>
            <p>I ſtand here aſtoniſhed at this ignorance: Do I read in a Doctor, that Contrition without <hi>Ritual</hi> and <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> Confeſſion doth not reconcile a ſinner, and that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> Decrees this expreſly? I ſay firſt, that the Council expreſly declares the contrary. <hi>Sect. 14. cap. 4. de contritione: Docet praeterea</hi> [Sancta Synodus] <hi>&amp; Si contritionem hanc aliquando charitate perfectam eſſe contingat, hominem Deo reconciliare, prius quam hoc Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum actu ſuſcipiatur,</hi> &amp;c. The Holy Synod teaches, <hi>Although it ſometimes falls out, that this Contrition when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with Charity, reconciles a man with God before actual ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Sacrament,</hi> &amp;c. The words are contrary to the Doctors aſſertion, and need no explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I ſay, 2. It is the certain and conſtant Doctrine of Divines, that Contrition (proceeding from the Love of God, or true motive of Charity) in the very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107258:51"/> a Soul hath it, gain's pardon, reconciles to God, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſes immediately to ſupernatural Grace, whereby a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is juſtified, and made an adopted Child of God; and this I ſay, In the <hi>very Moment a Soul hath it,</hi> though Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Confeſſion follows not, for weeks, or months, or by accident never; for would it not be apittiful caſe to ſend a poor ſinner to Hell, who lies at deaths door, or is mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded, &amp; doth his utmoſt to be contrite for his ſins, though neither Prieſt is preſent, nor Sacramental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion can be had or hoped for? This very caſe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to unbeguile the Doctor, and to ſatisfie him that we Catholicks are not ſo ſevere in exacting Sacramental Confeſſion, when either accident or neceſſity excludes a poor penitent from it.</p>
            <p>I know not how the Doctor will come off, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for the enormious injuſtice done, both to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> and all Catholicks, but by one evaſion that ſhall nothing at all avail him.</p>
            <p>Perhaps he may tell us, that when he ſays, <hi>Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without Sacramental Confeſſion will not reconcile us,</hi> he only ſpeaks of <hi>Votive Confeſſion</hi> included in the Act of Contrition, and not of Actual. No, I thought Ritual, as he terms it, and Sacramental Confeſſion had been in plain Engliſh Synonimas, or of the ſame ſignification with Actual Confeſſion. However, if the Doctor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it of Votive Confeſſion, read his words thus: <hi>Contrition without Confeſſion in Vote or deſire, reconciles not a ſinner to God,</hi> and this you muſt ſuppoſe to be his meaning. Then know, we Catholicks hold conſtantly, that Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without the <hi>Vote</hi> or Efficatious will of Confeſſion is no Contrition, conſequently all he proves is, that that Act which is no Contrition <hi>doth not reconcile to God.</hi> How then doth he advance any new proof againſt us? Where lies the Miſchief or Malignity of our Doctrine
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107258:51"/> in ſaying, that an Act, which is no Contrition and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not in <hi>Voto</hi> to Gods Command, <hi>doth not reconcile us to God?</hi> yet more.</p>
            <p>If he ſpeaks not of Actual, but Votive Confeſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in Contrition, his whole diſcourſe is lame, hobling, and renders you this Non-ſence: As Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Sacramental Confeſſion (in Vote or deſire) <hi>doth not reconcile us to God,</hi> ſo attrition with actual, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Confeſſion doth reconcile us, which inference without life and vigor, ſhews nothing to the Doctors purpoſe; for what doth it avail him to ſay in this place, as no Contrition doth reconcile us, ſo Attrition with the Sacrament doth? Had he ſaid, as Contrition with Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Confeſſion reconciles us to God, ſo Attrition alſo with Actual Confeſſion doth; the ſence had been good and Catholick: But never ſhall he make ſence out of theſe words: <hi>As Contrition without Confeſſion will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us to God, ſo,</hi> &amp;c. unleſs he ſpeaks (as really he doth) of <hi>Actual Confeſſion</hi> as well requiſite for reconciliation when a ſinner is contrite, as when he is attrite only, which is injurious to Catholicks. If you ponder well what I have ſaid, you'll find the Doctor in a Labarinth, pull him out who will.</p>
            <p>He goes on in his ignorance, and ſaith firſt, <hi>that with us there is no neceſſity of Contrition at all. Anſw.</hi> Moſt Untrue: It is neceſſary in a thouſand caſes of death and danger, when Attrition only will not avail without the Sacrament. He ſaith, 2. <hi>A little repentance will prevail as well as the greateſt;</hi> and cites <hi>Gulielmus de Rubeo;</hi> (he means <hi>de Rubeone.</hi>) I anſw. Two things may be conſidered in repentance: for Example in an Act of Contrition: The firſt is, the ſubſtance of that Act which implies a ſorrow for having ſinned againſt God, and offended his infinite goodneſs, with purpoſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107258:52"/> and this appretiative eſteem of God is the ſame, and intrinſecal to every Act of Contrition, ſo much perfection it hath, or 'tis not Contrition. The ſecond, is the gradual remiſeneſs or intenſneſs of it, which may be various in a ſinner; if remiſs, it gains leſs Grace, if intenſs, more; and therefore upon this account benifits the ſinner accordingly. But know, that the Doctor can never ſhew, either by Scripture or any received Authority, that Contrition, which is a remorſe for ſin upon the motive now ſpecified ought to have ſuch a gradual intention for the remiſſion of it; and this is all that <hi>Gulielmus de Rubione, Tolet,</hi> and others ſay in our preſent controverſie. If the Doctor will have more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſubject, he may read <hi>Suarez tract. de chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. Sect. 2. n.</hi> 2. (and well Learn of him) that the gradual intention in acts of love towards God, is not neceſſary to comply with the precept of Loving him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all: <hi>Suarez</hi> his words are: <hi>Illa perfectio dilectionis dei pertinet ad ſpeciem, &amp; naturam talis actus qui ſaluatur in quavis intenſione. The perfection of Charity belongs to the ſpecies or nature of the Act, which is had whether the Act be more or leſs intens.</hi> If <hi>Suarez</hi> his Authority like not the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, I expect his Scripture to the contrary, and with all deſire he would plainly ſay, how ſtrong an intention in Contrition is neceſſary to reconcile a ſinner, and this by Scripture, or ſome approved Authority.</p>
            <p>Page 81. he ſhews himſelf little verſed in our Divines, where he tells you, that we ſay, if a <hi>man live a wicked life for 60 or 80 years, yet, if when he dyes (ſooner then which God hath not commanded him to repent) he be a little ſorrowful for his ſins, and though this ſorrow have no Love of God in it, if the Prieſt abſolve, he is ſafe, the Prieſt with two Fingers and a Thumb doth the work for him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:107258:52"/>
            <p>Firſt, I ſlight this jeer of two Fingers and a Thumb, God hath his Judgment for it, and may in time ſtupifie thoſe two Fingers and Thumb that writ it, as once he did <hi>Valens</hi> his whole hand for an intended injury againſt a Prieſt. Next to clear this doubt, our Divines hold, that a man is commanded to convert himſelf ſooner to God then in the Article of death; ſome whom <hi>Suarez Supar</hi> cites, <hi>Sect. 3. nu.</hi> 1. as <hi>Capreol</hi> and <hi>Scot,</hi> (too ſcrupulouſly) ſay, That as often as other precepts oblige us, (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) to give an Alms, ſo often Charity muſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the work done: others ſay not much leſs: <hi>Suarez</hi> teacheth and truely, <hi>n. 4. That this precept of loving God ſome time in mans life obligeth per ſe by its ſelf,</hi> and adds, <hi>that it is not to be deferr'd for a long time after the uſe of reaſon.</hi> Finally concludes, <hi>Qui per multos annos non exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet hunc actum amoris delinquit contra hoc praeceptum. He that for many years exerciſeth not this Act of Love, offends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the precept of Loving God.</hi> Now if the precept obliges all, much more a ſinner, who is an enemy to God. And here by the way, you may ſee the Doctors Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above, pag. 76. further anſwered, and that <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldus</hi> and <hi>Navar</hi> there cited, have nothing contrary to this known and received Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But what if one ſins luſtily on for 60. or 80. years, and omits theſe acts of loving God and his duty every way, can he, if he comes in the Article of death, with Attrition <hi>only</hi> to a Prieſt, paſs into a ſtate of Salvation, though then he neither loves God, nor has true Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? I anſwer, That many both Learned and Grave Divines ſay No; not only, becauſe the precept tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed ſo long <hi>then if ever</hi> obligeth him, but upon this account chiefly, that ſuch an obdurate ſinner is bound in that dangerous hour to ſeek reconciliation with God, by the beſt and ſecureſt means; but an Act of Love and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107258:53"/> perfect Contrition are the ſecureſt; therefore to the one or other he is obliged. See <hi>Suarez</hi> now cited, <hi>num. 3. Con. diſp. 24. de charitate. dub. 5. concluſ.</hi> 3. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Withal be pleaſed to reflect, that the Doctor ſpake without book, when he ſo roundly told us, (as if none gainſaid it) that a <hi>little ſorrow and the fear of Hell only</hi> (which is falſe) <hi>though it has no Love of God with it, paſſeth a ſinner in the Article of death to a ſtate of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> All this is ſaid at random: But what will ye? his head was ſo taken up with his pretty conceit of the Prieſts two Fingers and a Thumb, that he forgot his Divinity.</p>
            <p>In his 2 <hi>Sect.</hi> pag. 82. He comes full charged againſt the uſe of Confeſſion among Catholicks, <hi>Though with the pious Children of the Church in</hi> England, <hi>it is of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe.</hi> Anſw. Beſides calumnies, and ſlanders in this Section he hath nothing worth notice. <hi>Princes,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and Prelates do often confeſs, and are never the better.</hi> How proves he this ſlander? or let him ſay, what is done better <hi>with his excellent uſe of Confeſſion among the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prelates in the Church of England.</hi> 2. He ſaith, That <hi>men look on this Cure like pulling off their Clothes.</hi> Anſw. A ſlander: But tell me, is it better in the Church of <hi>England</hi> among <hi>thoſe Pious Children</hi> he mentioneth? 3. <hi>That they confeſs to day</hi> (pag. 83.) and <hi>ſin to morrow.</hi> Anſw. And do none ſin to morrow, who confeſs to day in the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Confeſſion makes not men impeccable, yet is an excellent remedy to prevent ſin, and ſo our Doctor will ſuppoſe it is among <hi>the Pious Children of the Church of England.</hi> 4. He ſaith, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is made a Miniſter of State, a Pick-lock of Secrets, a Spie upon Families,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Calumny: The whole Chriſtian World knows the contrary, and I tell you the Doctor is more obliged to make reſtitution for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107258:53"/> the wrong done to Catholick Prieſts in this particular then any Theif is, who picks his pocket: But tell me, is Confeſſion a pick-lock with Catholicks only (in caſe all were true that he ſaith without conſcience) is there no <hi>Pick-lock of ſecrets, or ſpie upon Families among thoſe Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſters in the Church of</hi> England? I have heard the contrary, that whole Confeſſions have been revealed by them; whether true or no, I ſay not; yet I know well, that for the ſpace of forty years that I have lived in Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Countries, I never heard the leaſt complaint againſt Confeſſor for being a <hi>Pick-lock.</hi> The Doctor therefore may well expect Gods juſt Judgment on him for this injuſtice, unpardonably done, (unleſs he repents and makes reſtitution) to Catholick Prieſts. But enough of this Section.</p>
            <p>Pag. 86. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. he hath a bout with our <hi>Penance</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> and makes a long liſt of their abuſes. <hi>They are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>reduced from the ancient Canonical Penances to private and arbitrary; from years to hours; from great ſeverity to gentleneſs and flattery; from publick ſhame, to the ſaying over their beads; from Cordial to Ritual, from ſmart to money, from heartineſs and earneſt, to pageantry and theatrical Images of Penance.</hi> Anſw. Though 'tis true that the Church hath upon weighty reaſons much leſſened the rigor of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Penances, and therefore ſo frequently grant's Indulgences, yet what follows in this pretended Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of abuſes, is nothing but a long Liſt of Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, falſe and injurious. Falſe it is, that if the ſin confeſſed deſerves a years Pennance, we reduce it to an hours: Falſe, that we turn the ſeverity of Penance into flattery, (unleſs the Doctor calls the charitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting a poor penitent flattery.) No, ſo far are we from flattery in this Tribunal of Penance, that we lay open the enormity of ſin, threatning Gods Judgement upon
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107258:54"/> it, and ſpare no pains to beget a horror of ſinning in a penitents heart. Falſe it is, that if the ſin be enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or ſcandalous, the ſaying ones beads is enough. Falſe it is, that we exact only Ritual and not Cordial ſatisfaction. Falſe likewiſe, that when the penitent ought to ſmart for his ſin, the ſmart is turned into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; though I think the Doctor will not deny, but that in circumſtances of age or infirmity, when the penitent cannot bear auſterity, the charitable giving of Alms is laudable and ſatisfactory; at leaſt holy <hi>Daniel</hi> liked well of it: <hi>Cap. 4. 24. Peccata tua elemoſynis redime, &amp; iniquitates tuas miſericordiis pauperum. Redeem, make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for thy ſins with Alms-deeds, and thy iniquities with mercies of the Poor.</hi> Falſe, finally it is, that we require not heartineſs and <hi>earneſt</hi> in the performance of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Now what the Doctor means by his <hi>Pageantry and Theatrical Images of Penance,</hi> God I think only knows: Perhaps he blames ſome publick Penances now and then done in the Church; If ſo; firſt, all publick Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are not laid aſide. 2. You ſee the Peeviſhneſs of our Doctor, nothing eſcapes his cenſure; if Penances be private, the Ancient Canons ſuffer; if publick, they are <hi>pageantry and theatrical Images:</hi> What will content the man? When one ſtands there among you at a Pillar for Perjury, or in a white Sheet for Fornication; is this <hi>pageantry,</hi> or any <hi>threatrical Images?</hi> and what further uſe have you I beſeech ye, of theſe ancient Canonical Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances among the Pious Penitents of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, to conclude; the Doctor I am ſure deſerves juſtly a ſevere Penance for this heap of Calumnies, and if ever God (as I wiſh) make him a Catholick, and chooſe me for Confeſſor, he ſhall have it home without flattery; an hours Penance, or ſaying his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107258:54"/> Beads will be too little; in a word, his Penance ſhall be proportionate to his ſin, and if he thinks it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, let him go on Gods name to <hi>Sancta Maria de populo,</hi> for the gaining of thoſe thouſand Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences he mentioneth. He holds on this <hi>3d.</hi> Section, and tells you of ſtrange Indulgences granted to ſeveral places, whether truly or no, it imports little: Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit he ſpeaks truth, all he gets is that the Church is liberally good to ſuch great ſinners as he is, who as Holy <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Drink iniquity like water;</hi> and if after their repentance, it grants them Mercy, what offence is there in doing ſo? In the reſt of that weightleſs Section, while he explicates what Divines ſay of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences; ſometimes he hits right, ſometimes miſſes, but is ordinarily very plentiful in jeers, all ſlight ſtuff: I leave him; only be pleaſed to reflect, how, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pointing to any place, he cites <hi>Gerſon</hi> and <hi>Soto</hi> againſt himſelf, for if it be true, that <hi>Soto</hi> ſaith in 4 <hi>Sent. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. 21 q. 2. a. 1. That the Pope never grants theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences for a 100. or 1000. years,</hi> The Doctor hath no more to ſay, but that ſuch pardons are not at all (the Queſtuaries <hi>only</hi> procured them) and conſequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugns what never was.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The ſum of our Doctors diſcourſe concerning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences. His two miſtakes are diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. His Objections anſwered.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Doctor pag. 91. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. pretends much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charity to our Souls, and to unbeguile us, will needs add one <hi>conſideration more:</hi> And what is this think you? Marry, <hi>There is no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth in theſe new Divices; and this to boot, that when our Doctors are pinched with an objection, they let their hold go,</hi> &amp;c. Good man! Are theſe his conſiderations? A young Student in Divinity, would make good ſport with ſuch conſiderations. But, <hi>ad rem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conſtantly affirm, that all he has ſaid in this Section, hath not ſo much as a ſhadow of an objection in it againſt the received Doctrine of Indulgences, much leſs any that <hi>pinches.</hi> To prove my aſſertion, be pleaſed to have in mind what this received Doctrine is, which the <hi>Council of</hi> Trent <hi>ſeſſ. 25. decret. de Indulg.</hi> declares thus: <hi>Sacro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancta Synodus Indulgentiarum uſum, Chriſtiano populo maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſalutarem, &amp; ſacrorum conciliorum authoritate probatum in Eccleſia retinendum eſſe docet, &amp; praecipit. The holy Synod teaches, that the uſe of Indulgences is moſt wholeſome and profitable to Chriſtians; and commands this uſe approved by the Authority of holy Councils, to be held ſtill in the Church.</hi> Next, it requires a moderation in granting Indulgences,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107258:55"/> according to the Ancient Cuſtome of the Church, and that all abuſes crept in, be amended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Catholick truth ſuppoſed: you'll find the Doctor ſtrangely beguiled, and his whole diſcourſe (chiefly founded on two miſtakes) weaker then a Bul-ruſh. His firſt miſtake is, that becauſe Catholicks cannot arrive to a certain knowledge of gaining an Indulgence, or the full fruit of it, he thinks no truſt is to be had in it, no endeavour uſed to purchaſe this Grace. An error: For Divines ſay, and truly, no one can know with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he hath an act of true ſupernatural Faith, or of true Charity in that Degree, Purity and Meaſure which God exacts; is therefore Faith and Charity (<hi>without truſt</hi>) to be laid aſide? is our endeavour to have them careleſly to be left off? is it wholly uſeleſs and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table? God forbid.</p>
            <p>His ſecond error is, that he builds too much upon thoſe many difficulties which our Divines raiſe in this matter of Indulgences, while they ſpeculatively diſcuſs ſeveral caſes relating to them; and becauſe this is done with variety of Opinions, the Doctor thinks all undone, and that both the ſuſtance and fruit of Indulgences fail's in the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>A great miſtake: For are there not innumerable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties ſpeculatively examined almoſt in every Article of Chriſtian belief, concerning Baptiſm and other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments? yes, concerning the profeſſion of our Faith in certain exigences: yet theſe ſpeculative conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons terrifie none from profeſſing the neceſſity and benefit both of faith and Sacraments. The like with a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion we ſay of Indulgences (not ſo neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Faith or Baptiſm;) though difficulties in <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> particular caſes are moved concerning them, yet all
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107258:56"/> agree in the general with the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that they are uſeful, profitable and beneficial to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian penitents.</p>
            <p>Having thus diſcovered the two tranſcendent miſtakes of our Doctor, you ſhall ſee how unskilfully he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates againſt Indulgences.</p>
            <p>Page 92. he ſaith, <hi>Suppoſe the Indulgence be for forty years, a hundred, a thouſand; yet peradventure according to the old penitential rate, you have deſerved the Penance of forty thouſand years,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> A long time indeed! but peradventure this <hi>peradventure</hi> of the Doctors is a miſtake; at leaſt ſomething is gained beſides the merit of the work, though we know not how much; and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is to have forty years of Penance taken off, then to ſuffer torment for forty years, though not yet quitted of all pain. (If the damned in Hell could but have forty years of their pain releaſed, thsy would deem it a favour) Therefore the Doctrine of the <hi>Council of Trent is</hi> true: <hi>Uſus indulgentiarum eſt ſalutaris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again he ſaith, <hi>No man can tell the difference, when what remains ſhall be ſo great as to ſurmount all the evils of this life.</hi> Anſw. Neither is it neceſſary: The duty of a good Chriſtian is to take off what pain he can, though he knows not in what meaſure; and if he diminiſhes but ſome little, the uſe of Indulgences is both good and profitable. I leave that jeer of the <hi>Daemoniack</hi> with the Doctor; and tell him that if one poor ſoul were poſſeſſed with a legion of Deviles, and had moral aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that he is freed of ſome (though he knows not of how many) that little releaſement would be of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>Page 93. He goes on doubting. <hi>It may be your Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragenes, are not carenes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It may be you have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ehaſed but ſome lighter thing; and then, if your demerit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107258:56"/> to ſo many Carenes, and you have purchaſed but meer Quadragenes, you may ſtay longer in Purgatory then you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</hi> Anſw. It may be the Doctor is deceived in all he ſaith here: It may be a penitent gets all he expected. But admit he doth not, ſomething is got, (he hath at leaſt the merit of his work) though he knows not how much. The not knowing of his gain doth not leſſen it. Though the Doctor knows not preciſely how pure his Act of Charity is, the value of it is ſo much in the ſight of God, neither more nor leſs, upon the account of his own not knowing it.</p>
            <p>He ſaith again: <hi>It is not agreed among Doctors, whether a plenary Indulgence is to be extended beyond the taking off thoſe Penances, which were enjoyned by the Confeſſor.</hi> Anſw. Though it be moſt true that a plenary Indulgence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from lawful Authority, granted upon a Juſt and Pious Cauſe, extends it ſelf to the taking away of all pain, if the penitent complys with his duty; yet here we will not enter on this Queſtion, nor ſay, how ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Turrecremata</hi> with the others are cited. Content we are with that which the Doctor does not deny, viz. <hi>That Indulgences take off thoſe Penances enjoyned by the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor:</hi> And with this ſmall Pittance of Pardon we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> ſaith true: <hi>Uſus Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum eſt ſalutaris. The uſe of Indulgences is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He further tells us, page 94. <hi>That if a perſon be not capable of an Indulgence, becauſe he is not in the ſtate of Grace, he gains nothing.</hi> Anſw. No one doubts of this. The only wonder is that our Doctor ſpends his Ink and Paper to no better purpoſe. Soon after he ſaith, that <hi>Pope</hi> Adrian <hi>troubles the whole affair again,</hi> and for it he cites <hi>Petrus Suavis Polanus in his Hiſtory of the Council of Trent</hi> to prove juſt nothing: <hi>Polanus</hi> his words are (though
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107258:57"/> his Authority is little with me) <hi>Pontifex, qui ut Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Pope, who as a Divine had writ of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences (before</hi> Luther <hi>ever handled the matter) thought to eſtabliſh by an Apoſtolical Decree, what he had formerly taught as a private Doctor.</hi> And what is this Doctrine of <hi>Adrian</hi> a private Doctor? <hi>Quando Indulgentia concedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur alicui,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>When an Indulgence is granted to any body, it may be he doth not the work required to be done ſo perfectly, as to gain the whole Indulgence: Now if any thing be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the perfection of the work, he gains not the whole Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but a part of it, correſponding to the Work, leſs well performed.</hi> What is here for the Doctors advantage? What is here againſt the <hi>Council of Trent? Uſus Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiarum eſt ſalutaris.</hi> Something is got by Indulgences according to <hi>Adrian,</hi> who only ſpake as a private Doctor Were any thing amiſs, as in reaſon there is not. But here I muſt tyre you with a piece of the Doctors ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who ſaith, <hi>That if the Indulgence be only given accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the worthineſs of the work done, then that (viz.</hi> the work) <hi>will avail of it felf, without any grant from the Church.</hi> A ſtrong Objection! I anſwer, The work will avail of it ſelf to merit, and if penal, to ſome ſatisfaction, but not to the releaſing of ſo much temporal pain as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence takes off, in caſe it be worthily comply'd with.</p>
            <p>The Doctors <hi>greater heap of dangers,</hi> which he ſets down from his 6. <hi>number</hi> of <hi>pag.</hi> 94. to 98. hath ſo little danger of an Objection, that to read them is to anſwer them. For what ſence is there to tell us, <hi>That we muſt be ſure of the Authority of him that gives the Indulgence?</hi> We have all Moral aſſurance for it, and incomparably greater then any one hath in <hi>England,</hi> that his Miniſter Preaches with Authority to Preach, or delivers true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. What ſence is there to ask. <hi>If one has an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107258:57"/> for the Article of death, and dies not then; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a new one is to be got for the next ſickneſs?</hi> As doughty an objection it is, that he hath concerning the <hi>Gregorian Calendar:</hi> as likewiſe, his doubt whether a Pope can recal an Indulgence granted by his Predeceſſor. This and a great deal more which the Doctor has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter is (he himſelf knows it) moſt emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtuff.</p>
            <p>But you'll ask what I ſay to the great objection he toucheth on here: pag. 96. and propoſeth more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the beginning of this Section, concerning the emptying of Purgatory? <hi>Certainly the Millions of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and innumerable other helps in the Church ſhould ere this have a hundred times over evacuated that place of its ſad Inhabitants.</hi> I anſwer, this Objection is like the reſt, feeble and forceleſs; and would the Doctor ponder well theſe words of the <hi>Royal Prophet Pſal. 100. Miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiam &amp; judicium cantabo tibi, Domine,</hi> He would ſee the weakneſs of it: <hi>God is Merciful, but withal juſt.</hi> His Mercy impowers the Church to free many: But that prodigal uſe of the Keys in freeing all, would be againſt Juſtice, and would make ſinners little to value or fear thoſe torments, which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, <hi>Surpaſs all the pains in this World.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>A word more of Indulgences. Of the Doctors Miſtakes in quoting Authors. Whether the Prayer of a ſinner avails him. Of the Doctors harſh Doctrine.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Doctor after his High <hi>heap of dangers</hi> and great number of little doubts, pag. 97. tells us that there is one thing neceſſary, <hi>viz. To work out our Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> Anſw. Firſt, a poor penitent that apprehends moſt deeply the pain of Purgatory, and doth ſo much Penance as we ſee daily done among good Chriſtians for the releaſment of that pain, cannot be ſuppoſed in any Chriſtians Charity to be without <hi>fear and trembling.</hi> 2. We might (if it were worth the while) move as many doubts concerning this <hi>fear and trembling,</hi> as he doth againſt Indulgences. We might ask him to work out our Salvation: how often muſt we <hi>fear?</hi> How often muſt we <hi>tremble?</hi> From what motive-muſt this <hi>fear</hi> proceed? How ſtrong and intens muſt this <hi>trembling</hi> be? when all is done: How know we that we have <hi>trembled</hi> enough? and whether we are not to <hi>tremble,</hi> till we all turn Quakers? Let the Doctor reſolve theſe doubts upon good certainty; and I'll warrant you, his ſcruples about Indulgences will ceaſe. What he adds <hi>of Venial ſins hindring the fruit of Indulgences,</hi> is not worth taking notice of. But,</p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:107258:58"/>
            <p>Saith he, pag. 99. <hi>Pope</hi> Adrian <hi>taught a worſe matter,</hi> viz. <hi>He that will obtain an Indulgence for another,</hi> &amp;c. And where find we this <hi>worſe matter?</hi> Mark, I beſeech you, his Marginal Quotation, <hi>Apud Petrum de Soto. lect. de inſtitut. Sacerd. de neceſſariis ad effectum Indulg.</hi> Truly our Doctor all along hath been unfortunate in his citations, and here he ſhews himſelf ſo very unskilful, that I believe he never ſaw <hi>Soto.</hi> Know then that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus de Soto;</hi> beſides other works, hath a book in a large <hi>Decimo ſexto,</hi> which he Intitles: <hi>Tractatus de inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutione ſacerdotum,</hi> (with me it is printed at <hi>Brixia, anno</hi> 1586.) under that Title in general he handles many Queſtions, <hi>De ſcientia ſacerdotum, de Baptiſmo,</hi> and <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacraments;</hi> &amp;c. Every Treatiſe he devides into <hi>Lectiones:</hi> And after the middle of the Book hath a Title, <hi>de Indulgentiis,</hi> pag. 263. This Treatiſe he divides into three <hi>Lectiones.</hi> Now the Doctor gives you not the Right <hi>Lectio</hi> of that Treatiſe (which is the third in number) but unskilfully directs you to his <hi>Lectio de Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutione ſacerdotum:</hi> There is no general <hi>Lectio,</hi> but <hi>Tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus de inſtitutione ſacerdotum,</hi> the <hi>Lections</hi> are <hi>ſubdiviſions</hi> to ſeveral Treatiſes.</p>
            <p>Well, though without much help from the Doctor we have found the place in <hi>Soto: Lectio</hi> 3. now cited page (with me) 275. his words are: <hi>Notat Hadria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus circahoc, &amp; movet quaeſtionem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Adrian (who by the way</hi> ſpeaks not as <hi>Pope,</hi> but as a Divine or private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor) <hi>propoſeth this Queſtion, whether one in mortal ſin can avail to obtain an Indulgence for another, as if an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> (for Example) <hi>be granted to him who gives an Alms, or to him for whom it is given by another. Adrian</hi> holds the Affirmative, <hi>So that he who doth the work, and wiſheth the Indulgence to another, doth an action Morally good: Nam pro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> peccato non conceditur Indulgentia: For an Indulgence
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107258:59"/> is never granted for a ſinful work.</hi> This I ſay, was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians</hi> private Opinion not ſo harſhly related by <hi>Soto,</hi> as it is by our Doctor, who talks as if it were a definition of a <hi>Pope. Pope</hi> Adrian <hi>taught a worſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cenſure not <hi>Adrians</hi> Opinion (he was a great Divine) nor approve it; yet this I'll ſay, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor doth not ſo much as probably impugn it. Mark how weakly he argues: <hi>As if,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a man could do more for another, then he can do for himſelf.</hi> Anſw. Moſt certainly he may: Cannot one uncapable of a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or a favour in a Common-wealth, beg of his Prince a Grace for another who is capable? A meer ſecular man, unlearned and Married, may petition his Majeſty (and perhaps prevail) that Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> be the next Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (who they ſay lives ever unmarried.) Here is our very Caſe: This ſecular man is uncapable of ſuch a Grace: So a ſinner is of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. This ſecular man prevails to get the Grace for another who is capable: ſo a ſinner may prevail to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Indulgence for another juſt man capable of the favour. (The parity holds exactly) Therefore it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that one may do more for another then he can for himſelf in ſome caſes. The Doctor goes on, and ſpeaks not like a Chriſtian: <hi>As if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God would regard the Prayers of a wicked perſon when he intercedes for another, and at the ſame time, if he Prays for himſelf, his Prayer is an abomination.</hi> Anſw. This laſt is certainly impious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for the conſequence of it muſt needs be this; <hi>That no ſinner ought in conſcience ever to Pray for himſelf.</hi> I'll prove what I ſay thus: No ſinner can in conſcience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an abomination in the ſight of God, or ſin mortally: But to pray for himſelf is an abomination, and a mortal ſin: therefore no ſinner can in conſcience pray for himſelf.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107258:59"/> Conſequently that poor Publican, (9 <hi>Ioan</hi>) that prayed for himſelf <hi>Deus propitius mihi eſto peccatori. God be merciful to me a ſinner:</hi> Was an abominable man upon the account of his Prayer: which place of Scripture, no leſs a Doctor then St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> made uſe of, to prove that a ſinner may pray for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Were the Doctor a Divine, I could tell him that prayer in a wicked man may be a ſupernatural Act, and proceed from Gods Grace (not ſanctifying Grace) as Faith is ſupernatural, which preceeds juſtification in a ſinner. What he adds of <hi>a work done ungratiouſly,</hi> is a wrong to <hi>Adrian;</hi> who requires <hi>Opus Moraliter bonum: A work morally good,</hi> though <hi>not meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, the Doctor ſaith, that becauſe Divines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſtate of Grace neceſſary in a man at that time he gains an Indulgence, (though before a ſinner) <hi>they turn Divinity into Mathematicks and Clock-work.</hi> A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit not worthy a Doctor; ſay, I beſeech you, if this good man aſcends a Pulpit, and a larems his hearers thus. Good people, you have hitherto profited little by my Sermons: <hi>Hodie ſi vocem ejus audieritis: To day, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment, this minute, if you'll hear God ſpeak by me, you are happy,</hi> &amp;c. Doth he turn his Sermon into a <hi>Clock-work?</hi> Or, did the Apoſtle <hi>Clock</hi> it when he told the <hi>Corinthians Ecce nunc tempus acceptabile. Now is the time acceptable. Ecce nunc dies ſalutis. Now is the day of Salvation. 2 Cor.</hi> 6. Again. <hi>Hora eſt jam nos de ſomno ſurgere, nunc enim proprior eſt noſtra ſalus. 'Tis the hour now,</hi> &amp;c. Here is more of the <hi>Clock,</hi> of <hi>Minutes,</hi> and <hi>hours,</hi> then any Divine mentioneth in our preſent matter.</p>
            <p>Yet more. Pray ſee how artificially he windes about to bring in his <hi>Clock-work.</hi> Though ſaith he, it be <hi>not neceſſary, that when the Indulgence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is granted, the man
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107258:60"/> be in the ſtate of Grace; yet it is neceſſary that at ſome time or other,</hi> within the term preſcribed of the Indulgence, if he will gain it. And to make his conceit of his <hi>Clock</hi> to run on: he adds: <hi>At any time (it ſeems) it wil ſerve,</hi> which ſounds falſly, and is ſo; but here is enough of this <hi>Clock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next he blames ſome Divines who ſay, <hi>That if a man ſin in hope of Iubilee, or Indulgence to be granted after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he may yet gain the pardon.</hi> Anſw. He may ſo, unleſs the Indulgence poſitively excludes ſuch a man from the favour: Why? the guilt of that ſin is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible by Contrition and Penance; and ſo likewiſe is the temporal pain due to it pardonable, by vertue of an Indulgence.</p>
            <p>Page 100. He is upon his old miſtakes again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Contrition, and thinks it may be ſufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either act or deſire of Confeſſion. This is anſwered above.</p>
            <p>Page 101. After the praiſe he gives to that excellent uſe of Confeſſion among <hi>the Pious Children of the Church of England:</hi> He finds fault with our ſatisfaction and Penance, much taken away by the new Doctrine of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Moſt evident it is, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many Indulgences granted, that the Ancient uſe of Penance is in a manner only found among Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks: Theſe are they who faſt, theſe Pray, theſe curb their paſſions, theſe often practiſe great Auſterity; yes, and live ſometimes in a mean condition, to relieve the Poor. A Volume would not ſuffice to expreſs the fruit of their hearty Repentance and eminent Charity, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to our eyes in every Town and City. Now for Gods-ſake, what have we like this among Proteſtants? The hearing of a Sermon on Sunday is the moſt they do; and yet there is no <hi>Declenſion</hi> of primitive Diſcipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107258:60"/> them. Would to God our Doctor were ſhut up in a <hi>Carthuſians</hi> Cell, and lived as they live but for one year only: he would both practice and ſee more Penance done, then he hath either practiſed, or ſeen in <hi>England</hi> for his whole life; and yet forſooth, we muſt hear his Lord-ſhip talk <hi>of a Declenſion in Primitive Diſcipline,</hi> and think <hi>all fine,</hi> when he <hi>words it, with living Godly in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never ſaw that book of <hi>Taxa Camerae,</hi> which the Doctor mentions, pag. 102. and therefore cannot ſay what is in it, likely it is a Libel; ſure I am that <hi>Claudius Eſpencaeus</hi> wiſhes it ſuppreſſed, and if as he ſaith, <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimis quidem licentia, omnibus autem abſolutio empturientibus propoſita. That licence is given to many, and abſolution propoſed to all that buy it.</hi> I cannot but judge ill of the book; and as ill of the Doctor who Engliſhes <hi>Eſpencaeus,</hi> thus—<hi>And yet to them who will pay for it, there is to many given a Licence, and to all an abſolution for the greateſt and moſt horrid ſins.</hi> Pray you what may theſe words, <note n="*" place="margin">Mark how the Doctor equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates in thoſe words. <hi>To them that will pay for it.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>yet to them who will pay for it</hi> ſignifie? do they relate to the Book, or to the Licenſe and abſolution for ſin? if the ſecond, the whole ſence is: <hi>They who will lay down money, have Licenſe, (many at leaſt) to ſin, and all have abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from the moſt horrid ſius.</hi> If the Doctor works this ſence out of <hi>Eſpencaeus</hi> his words, he is more then uncharitable, to think that ever Pope or Prelate favoured that book; it is an infamous Libel that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends Licenſe given to ſin. The beſt ſolution therefore is, that <hi>Eſpencaeus</hi> is blamable as appears by the <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> of Cardinal <hi>Zapata</hi> printed, <hi>Hiſpali.</hi> 1631. where this very ſecond digreſſion of <hi>Eſpencaeus</hi> is prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. <hi>Vide verbum Claudius Eſpencaeus,</hi> page <hi>Indicis</hi> 219.</p>
            <p>The Doctor ſoon after cites you <hi>Auguſtinus Triumphus
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107258:61"/> de Ancona</hi> teaching, <hi>That the Pope ought not to grant Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences to them who have a deſire of giving money, but cannot; as to them who actually give:</hi> and he adds immediately: <hi>That in ſuch a caſe, it is not inconvenient that the Rich ſhould be in a better condition then the Poor.</hi> In my whole life did I never meet with ſuch a Doctor, who neither cites right nor ſaies right. Mark I beſeech you, how he cites <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtinus de Ancona</hi> in his Margent: <hi>De poteſtate Papae quaeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. ad</hi> 3. The Quotation is ridiculous, and no more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects you to find any thing concerning Indulgences then if he ſent you to the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> Know therefore briefly, that <hi>Auguſt. de Ancona</hi> writ a ſum of Divinity <hi>De poteſtate Eccleſiaſtica</hi> printed <hi>anno</hi> 1320. under which general Title he handles many Difficulties, and proceeds Methodically; firſt by Queſtions, next by Articles; then gives his reſolution; and finally ſolves the objections. At the beginning of his Book, his firſt queſtion is, <hi>De poteſtate Papae,</hi> and hath nine Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles under it: in the third Article not a word of our preſent matter, nor in any ſolution <hi>ad</hi> 3. In his <hi>third Queſtion</hi> he treats <hi>De eligentium juriſdictione,</hi> and hath ten Articles under it, and ſo many Reſolutions and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, not a word of Indulgences. In the mean while you ſee that our Doctors direction; <hi>De poteſtate Papae quaeſt. 3. ad</hi> 3. Helps you nothing. He ſhould (had he lighted on the right queſtion) have pointed out the Article, and then his <hi>ad</hi> 3. might have guided the Reader.</p>
            <p>Well, I find in the 31. queſtion of <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> (far off from any 3. queſtion <hi>De poteſtate Papae) Articulo</hi> 4. where he treats of Indulgences) theſe words, <hi>ad 3. Si dives ita parum dat ut pauper, puto, quod non tantum habeat de Indulgentia dives ſicut pauper, quia tunc oportet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currere ad juſtam aeſtimationem facientis Indulgentiam, quae
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107258:61"/> penſanda eſt valere ſecundum facultatem dantis. Sed ſi ſic dicatur: quicunque dabit unum denarium &amp; dives illud daret, ſicut pauper; puto, quod tantum haberet dives ſicut pauper: quamvis tamen in hoc eſſent pares, in multis aliis melioris conditionis eſſet pauper, quam dives.</hi> The ſence is: <hi>If the Rich man gives as little as the Poor man, I think the Rich man will not gain ſo much of the Pardon as the other. Recourſe here muſt be had to his will that grants the Pardon. But if it be ſaid: whoever gives a penny</hi> (or ſuch a ſmall pittance) <hi>and the Rich man gives ſo much and the Poor man alſo. Theſe two will be equal, and the one have as much as the other; yet upon other accounts the Poor mans condition will be better.</hi> Here is all I can find in this Author, and it is moſt blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Doctrine, nothing to the Doctors ſence, <hi>viz That Indulgences are not to be given to them who have a deſire of giving money, but cannot. And that in ſuch a caſe, it is not inconvenient that the Rich ſhould be in a better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then the Poor.</hi> If the Doctor will give me better direction to find what he quotes out of this or any other Author, he ſhall have his anſwer. But I perceive his way is not to examine the Originals, and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeth a ſimple Reader; who when he ſees ſuch a clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Marginal Quotations glitter like the Sun, thinks our Doctor more Learned then <hi>Rabbi Kimki.</hi>

            <p>THe Doctor, pag. 103. and 6 Section (I think his <hi>5th.</hi> Section hath ſuffered ſhip-wrack in the fourth, no great loſs of it) aſſaults us many ways.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107258:62"/> cauſeleſly laies them on another, nor makes <hi>his purſe the penitent;</hi> No, it is a ſlander to ſay that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned ſatisfaction is thus bought off with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>Next comes the Doctors weighty Argument: <hi>For by this Doctrine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>viz. that one man may ſatisfie for another: it is not to be ſaid of Chriſt alone, that he was wounded for our transgreſſions, that he only ſatisfied for our ſins.</hi> I anſwer, If this Argument have force, it proves as much againſt a mans own ſatisfaction, as againſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction done by another; for if Chriſt ſatisfied for all, (in the Doctors ſence) the Penitents own ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (who is one amongſt all) is vain and fruitleſs, which is not here in queſtion. Again, our good Doctor gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaies all the ſeverity of thoſe ancient Canonical Penances practiſed in the Church, and praiſed by him; for if Chriſt only hath ſatisfied for all; what need was there of ſuch rigid Penances among the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians? it was done to their hands by Chriſt, their Penances therefore were ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>2. He blames us for ſaying, <hi>The habit of ſin is no ſin diſtinct from the former Actions by which the habit was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</hi> So the Doctor, page 104. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here is the moſt ſtrange Doctrine I ever read. Know therefore, that Divines diſtinguiſh between actual ſin; habitual ſin, which is ſin paſt, not yet pardoned; and the habit of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generated by frequent acts of vice, which makes a man unhappy, prone, ready, and facile to ſin again, juſt as the often repeating of a Verſe gives facility to ſay it anew with eaſe.</p>
            <p>Now to affirm that this habit contracted by former multiplyed acts of ſin, is a ſin; ſeems a piece of new coyned Divinity: and proves that no ſinner habituated in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107258:63"/> Vice if he dies immediately after his firſt act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, or ardent Love of God (which juſtifies him) can be ſaved. Why? This fervent act of Contrition Roots not quite out the <hi>contracted habit of ſin;</hi> no ſaith our Doctor, (and truely) <hi>There is required a longer time, and a procedure in the Method of a holy life to do this:</hi> But this contracted habit of ſin, is a ſin, which the moſt fervent act of Contrition takes not away in a Moment; therefore if a ſinner dies ſuddenly after his firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, he cannot be ſaved; conſequently, had St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> departed this life, the next inſtant after her ardent Charity, ſhe had been a loſt Soul; and ſo the Doctor muſt ſay the good Theif on the Croſs is who had little time granted to Root out his bad ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</p>
            <p>What the Doctor adds, that in our Doctrine <hi>a man is not bound to interrupt the procedure of his impiety,</hi> is moſt unjuſt dealing; for ſuch an one is bound by the Law of God, and reaſon, not to ſin, yes and by Repentance too, in caſe Repentance be the only means to help him.</p>
            <p>The Doctor ſpeaks not well while he inſinuates that we are obliged to repent of our habits, if Repentance be taken properly: Repent we muſt of our ſins, and Root out ill habits by contrary acts of Vertue; this is our duty. Finally, he is ſtrangely out in ſaying, <hi>As for thoſe (ſins) that come after, they are excuſed, if they be produced by a ſtrong habit.</hi> Anſw. A ſtrong ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of erring brought forth this aſſertion; it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injurious to Catholicks, and as far from truth, as the Doctor is from honeſt dealing with us.</p>
            <p>Page 106. he teacheth that every venial ſin <hi>in its own Nature, and the rigor of Divine Iuſtice is damnable;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107258:63"/> and that in the unregenerate theſe venial ſins are ſo account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Anſw. Moſt mercileſs and execrable Doctrine againſt the very light of Nature: For who can ſay, (if a ſpark of Reaſon lives in him) that in caſe one by ſpecial favour paſs his whole life without all other ſin then once ſpeaking an idle word, and dies imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, who I ſay dare affirm that this man in rigor of Gods Divine Juſtice is a damned Soul, and muſt for that one little tranſgreſſion ſuffer the torments of Hell for eternity? Where is your Scripture, good Doctor, for this deſperate Doctrine? produce it, let us read the place with you; but never ſhall you do it, till you prove it by Scripture, that a Gnat is as big as a Camel, and a Mote in the Sun as great as a Houſe-beam: He may ſay the caſe now ſet down is ſomewhat extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; be it ſo, it implies no impoſſibility, and therefore laies open even to <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> the prodigious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The Doctor goes on, and tells us; <hi>That though venial ſins of their own Nature are damnable, yet by the Divine Mercy, the ſmaller committed by invincible ignorance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency or unavoydable infirmity, ſhall not be imputed to thoſe who love God.</hi> Anſw. Firſt, if theſe ſins be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the Unregenerate, as Infidels and thoſe who want Faith; I ſee not why they are not Damnable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the Regenerate; for theſe by reaſon of the great knowledge they have of Chriſtian Profeſſion, ſeem more obliged upon that very account to avoid venial ſins, then Infidels or the Unregenerate. 2. I Argue thus: Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> is (we'll ſuppoſe it) a man who loves God; we'll ſuppoſe alſo, what he ſaith, page 95. is true; <hi>That no man lives without the intromiſſion of venial ſins daily;</hi> from whence it follows that Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> hath ſuch a heap of evils in his Soul, which (though
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107258:64"/> he loves God) of their own Nature, and the rigor of Gods Juſtice may damn him for ever. If ſo, I ask why Gods Juſtice (overcome as it were by Mercy) is leſs ſevere to theſe ſins, then to others which we call great and Mortal? No Reaſon can be given, but that thoſe leſſer ſins are venial, pardonable in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; theſe greater deſerve the ſeverity of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Pardonable I ſay they are, and little, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to Gods Juſtice and Mercy, and therefore mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy makes them not ſo, but finds them pardonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe little.</p>
            <p>Hence it follows, that no heap of venial ſins <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as venial,</hi> can equalize the gravity of one Mortal offence; for though the growth and numerous augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them add more miſery to a Soul; yet their increaſe is (as Divines ſpeak) <hi>in inferiori ordine</hi> in a lower Degree of Malice, and reach no more to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normity of a mortal ſin, (which make us enemies to God) then a thouſand idle words reach the indignity of high Treaſon againſt a Prince or Soveraign. I ſay <hi>conſidered as venial,</hi> for if the careleſs multiplying of venial ſins drive us on to the next ſtep or danger of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending mortally; the caſe is altered; <hi>Qui amat pericu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum peribit in eo. He that loves danger ſhall periſh in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor adds pag. 107 (<hi>That this Doctrine of ſins venial gives reſt to mens conſciences: and that concerning ſuch ſins we are bidden to be quiet</hi>) I anſwer, His miſtake is notorious. We inculcate, God knows, the danger of thoſe leſſer evils, we lay open their Malice, and ſay, That <hi>for every idle word an account muſt be given</hi> before a ſevere Judge. O but ſaies he, <hi>'Tis impoſſible to tell in a thouſand caſes which are, and which are not venial ſins:</hi> And pag. (108) <hi>If a Confeſſor ſays that's venial which is
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107258:64"/> mortal, your Soul is betrayed.</hi> Why ſo good Doctor? I anſwer then: The penitents duty is not perfectly to know what is, and what is not venial; but to have hearty ſorrow for his ſins committed, whether great or little. For no man ſaith I grieve for my ſins as <hi>little</hi> or only veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; but moſt <hi>ſecurely</hi> thus: I am ſorry for them all, as God knows them offenſive to his Divine Majeſty: And anſwerable to this ſorrow the Confeſſor gives abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore though his knowledge may in ſome caſes fail, and not rightly diſtinguiſh between ſins mortal and venial; yet his abſolution is good, for he abſolves from all, whereof the Penitent humbly contrite, accuſeth himſelf guilty.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Divines prudently follow in innumerable caſes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Opinion. Of the Doctors exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Of his miſtakes.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Doctor pag. 110. Sect. 7. lays about him to undo our <hi>Leading men</hi> concerning the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they hold of a probable Opinion. Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Judgment of Divines is this: That if an Opinion well examined by learned men, be not contrary to known received Doctrine, or any deciſion of the Church, it may be ſafely followed in practice; and this, though one grave Doctor ſays it; Provided, I ſay,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107258:65"/> that his Judgment be not oppoſite to the general recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Doctrine of others.</p>
            <p>The ground of this aſſertion is: Innumerable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties dayly occur in a Moral life relating to the practice of Vertue, to the ſhunning of ſin, to the doing of Juſtice; In fine, to a Chriſtian mans Obligation in a thouſand caſes; which difficulties can with no evidence be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided either by Scripture, or definition of the Church. Divines therefore, who are ſuppoſed both rational and beſt verſed in the Principles of Chriſtian Religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoydably muſt, when evidence cannot be had, opina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively Judge and give a probable deciſion to the doubts propoſed: and this I think neither our Doctor, nor any Proteſtant living can deny. For,</p>
            <p>If a Judge comes to Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> and tells him, Sir, this very day I am to pronounce Sentence againſt a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Delinquent, or muſt free him. To give ſentence againſt him I have Accuſers enough, and plenty of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: None can except againſt them, their proofs will make him guilty; yet I know moſt certainly by my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate knowledge that the man is innocent; my difficulty now is, whether as a publick perſon and Judge, I may condemn him as guilty upon the atteſtation of theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Witneſſes, or quit him (though to my prejudice) on the certain knowledge I have of his innocency. What will the Doctor ſay to this caſe? will he plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? He cannot; for both in his Books and Sermons he takes upon him to decide the greateſt Controverſies in Faith; and therefore of neceſſary muſt here anſwer a difficulty in practice: let him ſay what he pleaſeth, he can do no more, but follow a probable Opinion; for if he counſels the Judge to free this ſuppoſed delinquent, he hath a whole Army of School-men againſt him, if to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107258:65"/> condemn him, he hath as many contrary; none of theſe Doctors can be ſuppoſed to ſpeak againſt the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth; therefore they only deliver their proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Opinions, and ſo muſt our Doctor do likewiſe if he ſpeaks with either one ſide or other.</p>
            <p>A thouſand ſuch caſes are almoſt endleſly propoſed, where the Wit of man muſt reſt upon probability, without reaching to evidence in every particular caſe; only this reflex evidence we have, that none can ſin who follows <hi>the dictamen of Prudence.</hi> But he that adheres to a probable Opinion follows Prudence, (when evidence cannot be had) therefore he is blamleſs and ſins not. yet,</p>
            <p>One word more with our Doctor, who (pag. 79.) talks of ſomething, <hi>Their Writers have often proved in their Sermons and Books of Conſcience.</hi> I ask him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing they have ſuch books; whether there Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters reſolve every particular caſe of conſcience upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain undoubted Principles of Faith: if he ſays no; then they have probable Opinions among them alſo. If, yes; This very ſaying is at moſt no more then probable; and will be (upon ſolid Reaſons) contradicted by a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred as Learned Schollers as the Doctor is; therefore he muſt decide the caſe upon a prudent Opinion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability only. Yet more.</p>
            <p>Can the Doctor perſwade himſelf that all he ſaith in his Book runs on with ſuch evidence, that a judicious Reader muſt hold it demonſtrative? No. The moſt he can think, is that he diſcourſeth probably; and yet, by this meer probability he hopes to diſſwade the World from Popery. I ſay the moſt <hi>he can think;</hi> for I profeſs (and I have thouſands will Judge with me) there is not ſo much as one Section in it that comes neer a probability. Conclude then from hence; that if as the Doctor ſaith,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107258:66"/> page 111. <hi>It be not ſafe to follow</hi> Caius <hi>and</hi> Semproni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>in a probable Opinion, becauſe they are but private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors;</hi> Much leſs is it ſafe to follow Doctor <hi>Taylor in his</hi> Diſſwaſive from Popery, (who at moſt ſpeaks but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably) and is no more but a private Doctor. What he adds at the end of this page, viz. <hi>That we ſuffer caſuiſts to determine caſes ſeverely, and gently: Entertain all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Pleaſe all diſpoſitions, and Govern them by their own inclinations, as they lift to be governed;</hi> &amp;c. Is in a word, a long liſt of miſtakes; and the Doctor is obliged in conſcience (by more then a probable Opinion) to unſay the ſlander.</p>
            <p>Now to ſome famous Quotations of our Doctor; who though he could ſhew that thoſe particular Opinions which he cavils at in the enſuing part of his Section, were as falſe as that impious Doctrine is <hi>of killing Kings, or</hi> Durands <hi>Opinion of Fornication;</hi> yet he gains nothing: for all at moſt he proves, is that <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Opinions are to be caſt aſide; which God knows, makes little to decry the Doctrine of a probable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>in general.</hi> Five or ſix Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> (and perhaps more) are worth little; is therefore their whole Miniſtry in general not to be valued.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>How the Doctor wrongs both the Canon Law and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Authors. Of his Quotations unworthily corrupted.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>OUr Doctor cites page 112. <hi>Emanuel</hi> Sa in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſms <hi>verbo. dubium.</hi> for this Doctrine; viz. <hi>If one Doctor ſay it is ſafe to ſwear a thing as of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which we do not know, but believe it is ſo, it is therefore probable that it is lawful to ſwear it.</hi> Anſw. <hi>Eman.</hi> Sa in this word <hi>Dubium,</hi> (with me printed at <hi>Antwerp</hi> 1599.) hath not one word of ſwearing (in which is particular difficulty) but <hi>numero</hi> 3. ſpeaks thus: <hi>Poteſt quis facere quod probabili ratione, vel authoritate putet licere, etiamſi oppoſitum ſit tutius. One may do what he thinks probable by Reaſon or Authority, though the contrary be more ſafe.</hi> What is here of ſafety to ſwear a thing as of our knowledge, which we do not know?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antonius de Eſcobar,</hi> Whom the Doctor ſhould have cited thus: <hi>Lib. 2. Theol. Moralis cap. 2. De conſcientia probabili,</hi> hath not a ſyllable of <hi>Swearing</hi> by any Warrant of a probable Opinion; but rather
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107258:67"/> the contrary. <hi>Moneo,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>n. 15. haud licere uti probabili Opinione, quando ex eâ magnum periculum ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur, vel proximi damni,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I put you in mind, that it is not lawful to uſe a probable Opinion, when either great danger or hurt of our Neighbour may follow on it;</hi> which may eaſily fall out, if we ſwear a thing as <hi>of our knowledge, which we know not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He tells you ſoon after a ſtory of Pope <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine the 4th. Who being accuſed in the Lateran Council for holding the See Apoſtolick when he was not in Orders, juſtified himſelf by the Example of two Biſhops:</hi> And he cites <hi>Nauclerus</hi> for the ſtory <hi>Generatione 21. &amp;</hi> 26. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Firſt, <hi>Nauclerus Generat.</hi> 21. hath not one word of Pope <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> much leſs this ſtory: <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat.</hi> 26. (with me, page 9.) he ſpeaks thus: <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitit autem per annum in Petri Cathedra Conſtantinus, &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopos Praesbiteroſque more Pontificum ordinavit, quouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que clero Populoque Romano in tribus foris—Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus eſt ejectus, &amp; in ejus locum omnium fuffragiis Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus 3. extitit ſuffectus,</hi> &amp;c. Conſtantine <hi>continued in the Chair of</hi> Peter <hi>for a year, and ordained Biſhops and Prieſts, as Popes were accuſtomed; until the Clergy and People of</hi> Rome <hi>aſſembled in there ſeveral places,</hi> &amp;c.—Conſtantine <hi>was caſt out, and by the Votes of all,</hi> Stephen <hi>was ſet in his place.</hi> Here is nothing of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, or the pretended Example of two Biſhops. You may ſee therefore how unlucky our Doctor is in his citations. 2. I anſwer, Admit that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> alledged the Example of two Biſhops, were either he or they on that account good or laudable? no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly: ſuch preſidents make no probable Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <pb n="125" facs="tcp:107258:67"/>
            <p>Next he cites you Cardinal <hi>Campegius</hi> and <hi>Alber. Pighius</hi> teaching, <hi>That a Prieſt lives more holily that keeps a Concubine, then he that hath Married a Wife.</hi> Anſw. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, firſt, I beſeech you, how our Doctor cites you theſe Authors without their places. Obſerve, 2. How he juggles in that word, <hi>He,</hi> which muſt relate ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a Secular man that may Marry; or to a <hi>Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Prieſt that is Married before his Prieſt-hood; or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, to a Latin Prieſt that cannot Marry, either <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeacute;,</hi> or <hi>Valide</hi> without diſpenſation. Hence I infer: whoever affirms that a Prieſt lives more holily that keeps a Concubine, then a ſecular man that may Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or a <hi>Graecian</hi> Prieſt that was Married before Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, delivers moſt impious Doctrine (<hi>Pighius</hi> never ſaid it.) Again, whoever affirmes, that a Prieſt that keeps a Concubine lives more holily then a Prieſt that Marrieth; talks <hi>De ſubjecto non ſupponendo;</hi> for a Latin Prieſt cannot Marry. If he therefore be ſo damnably wicked as to Marry a hundred times, his ſuppoſed Wife is no more but a Concubine; and then the Doctors Wiſe allegation muſt make this ſence: That Prieſt <hi>lives more holily that keeps a Concubine, then he that hath a Concubine.</hi> Perhaps <hi>Pighius</hi> may ſay, that if a Prieſt endeavours to Marry a Wife, as <hi>Luther</hi> did, and owns that Sacrilegious contract as a Marriage; To his impure living with a Harlot, he adds a new ſin: And this Doctrine is true.</p>
            <p>The Doctor goes on in the next lines: <hi>Seeing we find in the Popes Laws that a Prieſt is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved for Fornication; who will not, or may not practically conclude, that ſince by the Law of God Mariage is Holy, and yet to ſome men Fornication
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107258:68"/> is more Lawful; that therefore to keep a Concubine is very Lawful.</hi> Anſw. Let the Doctor ſpeak out plainly, and tell us to what men Fornication is more Lawful then Marriage: It is abſolutely unlawful in all; and therefore if we ſpeak properly, Fornication admits no Degree of being more or leſs Lawful. Had the Doctor ſaid, the ſacrilegious Fornication of a Preiſt is a leſſer evil then ſacrilegiouſly to uſe and own a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as his Wife, he had ſpoken ſence: But hence it follows not, that to keep a Concubine <hi>is very Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> Nay if (<hi>per impoſſible</hi>) Fornication were in ſome caſes Lawful, it doth not yet follow, that to keep a Concubine <hi>is very lawful:</hi> In a word, the Doctor ſays he knows not what.</p>
            <p>Now to the Popes Laws, which he cites ſo confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that no man underſtands him: He Writes in his Margent thus: 3. <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 7. which <hi>Canoniſts</hi> would take for <hi>Cauſa 3. q.</hi> 7. (but then the Chapter ſhould be added) not one word of this Subject in that <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 7. Then he adds, <hi>lata,</hi> which ſhould ſignifie the beginning of a Chapter: Where to find it no man knows, nor whether it relates to <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 7. or the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travag.</hi> Next follows, <hi>Extravag. de Bigamis.</hi> There is nothing <hi>de bigamis</hi> in the <hi>Extravag.</hi> in <hi>decret. tit.</hi> 21. There is <hi>de bigamis non ordinandis, cap.</hi> 5. yet nothing to this purpoſe; and I dare boldly affirm that in all the Canon Law, he ſhall not find either that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he attributes to <hi>Albertus Pighius,</hi> or <hi>That Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is more Lawful then Marriage in any.</hi> I wonder why the Doctor when he cites <hi>Campegius</hi> and <hi>Pighius</hi> for that filthy Doctrine <hi>of a Prieſts living more holily with a Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, then he that's Married;</hi> places directly againſt it, in his Margent the Canon Law; <hi>diſtinct. 82. can. Praeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:107258:68"/> in gloſſa,</hi> as if the Doctrine were allowed of. In a word, there is no ſuch thing, but expreſly the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The words are thus: <hi>Cap. 5. Presbiter. Si For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicationem feceret, quanquam ſecundum canones Apoſtolorum debeat deponi: tamen, juxta Authoritatem Beati Papae ſilveſtri, ſi in vitio non perduraverit, ſed ſua ſponte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſus adjecit, ut reſurgat, decem annis in hunc modum pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteat tribus quidem menſibus privato loco a caeteris remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, pane, &amp; aqua, a veſpera in veſperam utatur. A Prieſt, if he commits Fornication, although by the Canon of the Apoſtles he is to be depoſed, yet according to St.</hi> Sylve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>appointment, if he perſever not in that ſtate of ſinning, but having confeſſed willingly, amends his life, he is to do Penance for ten years in this manner. For the firſt three Months he is to live a part from others, and from Evening to Evening have only Bread and Water,</hi> &amp;c. And ſtill that Chapter goes on preſcribing further and moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Penances to ſuch a Delinquent. Read I beſeech you the whole Chapter, and never leave off to admire our miſtaken Doctor.</p>
            <p>Page 113. he cites <hi>Durandus: Sent. lib. 4. diſtinct.</hi> 33. (but gives you not the Queſtion under the Diſtinction.) Well, he means <hi>quaeſt.</hi> 2. towards the end. <hi>Durandus</hi> his words are: <hi>Quod autem quidam dicant, quod eſt pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum mortale de ſe, (nempe Fornicatio) excluſâ omni lege poſitivâ, Divinâ &amp; humanâ, non bene intelligo. But for what ſome ſay, that Fornication by it ſelf is a mortal ſin excluding all poſitive Law Divine and humane: I well underſtand not.</hi> Thus <hi>Durandus:</hi> And though his, <hi>non bene intelligo,</hi> be not aſſertive; yet he ſaith too much; and is therefore contradicted by the generality of moſt Learned Doctors. His Opinion then (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule given above) is not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107258:69"/> One Swallow makes no Summer, nor one Divine againſt the general received Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of others, makes no probable Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Next he cites <hi>Martinus de Magiſtris</hi> aſſerting, that it is not Heretical, to believe ſimple Fornication to be no ſin. Anſw. I have not now that Author by me; but yet believe, that the Doctor wrongs him. If he held ſuch a Tenet; I ſay it is Heretical, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no probable Opinion. Perhaps he may favour <hi>Durands</hi> Error too much, and that's all: I little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what <hi>Daniel Tilenus</hi> ſaies, he was an Heretick, and Writ a Book that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>magnus ille &amp; proprie dictus Antichriſtus.</hi> I think the Doctor will not ſay ſo.</p>
            <p>Next the Doctor cites Cardinal <hi>Tolet. Inſtruct. ſacerd. lib. 5. cap. 6. num.</hi> 15. Saying, <hi>That if a Noble man be ſet upon, and may eſcape by going away, he is not tyed to it, but may kill him that intends to ſtrike him with a ſtick.</hi> Anſw. The Doctor mangles <hi>Tolets</hi> Doctrine, and wrongs him exceedingly; whoſe words are: <hi>Ex quo fit, ut ſi nobilis invaſus poſſit vitam ſalvare fugiendo; non tenetur, (ſi inde infamian contrahit) fugere, ſed occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere hoſtem poteſt, ſi aliter vitam cum honore tutari non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. Whence it follows that if a Noble man ſet on, might ſave his life by running away, he is not obliged to it, if he gets infamy by his running away; but may kill the aggreſſor, if otherwiſe, he cannot defend his life with Honour.</hi> Now comes the ſtick: <hi>Similiter ſi non poteſt fugere injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am notabilem inferendam, ut ligni percuſſionem paratam, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt etiam tunc occidere inimicum. In like manner if this Noble man cannot avoid a notable injury, ready for him, as is a Baſtinado, or a ſtroke with a Cudgel
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107258:69"/> he may then kill his Enemy.</hi> Compare theſe words of <hi>Tolet</hi> with thoſe of the Doctor, and you'll ſee a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tolet</hi> ſaith again, <hi>lib. 4. cap.</hi> 13. (ſaith the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor) <hi>That if a man without advertency ſpeaks a blaſphemy in a ſtrong paſſion, not conſidering what he ſays, ſins not.</hi> Anſw. Yet he adds: <hi>Niſi cum homo eſſet aſſuetus Blaſphemare, nec vult emendationem: talis enim pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caret mortaliter tunc, quia eſt in culpâ praecedenti quia non abſtulit occaſionem peccati. Unleſs ſuch a man were accuſtomed to Blaſpheme and will not amend; for then he would ſin mortally in the precedent fault, and becauſe he took not away the occaſion of ſin.</hi> Theſe words the Doctor omits, to make <hi>Tolets</hi> Doctrine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, which yet is grounded in this certain Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; that as ſin is a free act; ſo it muſt ariſe from a knowledge or advertency of that evil, the will voluntary embraſeth. Hence you may ſolve that other Quotation out of <hi>Tolet, lib. 5. cap.</hi> 10. viz. <hi>If a man be beaſtly drunk and then commits For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, Fornication is no ſin; ſolve it I ſay;</hi> for the uſe of Reaſon is requiſite to every ſin; here is no uſe of Reaſon, <hi>Ergo,</hi> no ſin. And pray you, will the Doctor ſay that <hi>Lot</hi> ſinned mortally, when ſo drunk as he was; he committed Inceſt with his Daughters: Or will he hang a meer natural Sot in <hi>England,</hi> (who hath not Reaſon to know good from evil) for ſtealing thirteen pence half-penny? I would have this caſe plainly reſolved by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, if he holds that <hi>Lot</hi> ſinned mortally, and his reſolution brought to a clear and certain Principle; for if he gives not evidence in the deciſion of the caſe againſt <hi>Tolet,</hi> he can not by his own Rule make uſe of a probable Opinion.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:107258:70"/>
            <p>Once more <hi>Tolet</hi> is cited, page 114. for ſaying <hi>lib. 5. cap. 13. If a man deſires Carnal polution that he may be eaſed of his Carnal temptations, or for his health, it were no ſin.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſw. He highly abuſeth <hi>Tolet;</hi> who ſpeaks of no Laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Carnal deſire; ſo far is he from this, that he ſaith; if one takes complacency in it, <hi>Ob delectationem, for the delight had,</hi> he ſinneth mortally; and then adds: <hi>Dico ob delectationem, quia complacere ob ſanitatem, vel, ut carnales tentationes non ſint ita vehementes, non eſſet peccatum. I ſay for delight, for to be glad of it for health, or that carnal tentations be not ſo violent, it is no ſin.</hi> The end or motive is here far different; but to deſire or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in that filthy act, is ever a ſin and mortal.</p>
            <p>Yet one citation more remains of <hi>Eman.</hi> Sa which will make the Doctor famous; he referrs us to Sa, <hi>Tit. debitum conjugale n.</hi> 6. who (ſaith he) affirms, that if a <hi>man lyes with his intended wife before Marriage, it is no ſin, or a light one only.</hi> Anſw. Hear, I beſeech you, Sa his own words in my Edition printed at <hi>Antwerp anno</hi> 1599. (and never ceaſe to wonder at what the Doctor ſaith) <hi>n. 6. Copulariante benedictionem aut nullum, aut lene peccatum eſt, (&amp; ſi quidam mortale eſſe putant) quin etiam expedit, ſi multum illa (Benedictio) differatur.</hi> That is, <hi>For a man and Wife to lye together now married, before the Solemn Benediction of the Sacrament</hi> (not before Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage as our Doctor unworthily tells yee) <hi>although ſome think it a mortal ſin, is not ſo,</hi> but at moſt venial. <hi>Yes, its ſometimes expedient, if Benediction be put off for a long time, that they live together as Man and Wife;</hi> Did you ever hear of a Doctor that doth not diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of Marriage, and the <hi>Benediction</hi> of the Married couple? Thus much of the ſeventh Section.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of Attention neceſſary in prayer. One may pray that perfectly underſtands not the words of prayer. The Doctor quotes amiſs, and abuſeth <hi>Suarez.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Doctor in his 8, and 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Section hath much ſleight work, and his 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Section is a ſtory of Exorciſms. Of theſe a word. In paſſing I muſt not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to make him memorable for his quotations, you know this is my chiefeſt taſk.</p>
            <p>Pag. 117. Sect. 8. he ſaith. <hi>They teach, (we Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,) that prayers themſelves</hi> ex opere operato, <hi>or by natural work it ſelf, do prevail, for it is not eſſential to prayer, for a man to think particularly of what he ſayes; or, of the things ſignified by the words:</hi> So, (ſaith he) <hi>Suarez</hi> teaches. And where think you? <hi>lib. 3. de Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione cap.</hi> 4. ſayes the Doctor. Briefly. He ſhould firſt have cited the Tome, and the general Title of it thus; <hi>Tomo 2. de Statu Religionis</hi> before he came to the Book and chapter, but we will pardon this Leſſer Fault, and complain of a greater, and it is, that he wrongs <hi>Suarez</hi> unpardonably. <hi>Suarez</hi> ſayes no where in that whole chapter, (nor any Author I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read) that prayers prevail <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> or by the <hi>work it ſelf done,</hi> as the Sacraments prevail. He excludes no where attention, but requires it in prayer. Hear this Learned Authour <hi>num.</hi> 3. (in the chapter now cited.) <hi>Imprimis neceſſariam eſſe attentionem ut oratio honeſte fiat, communis est ſententia doctorum. Firſt that attention is neceſſary, that prayer be
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107258:71"/> well done, is the common opinion of Doctors, and this not onely in prayers we have of obligation, but in others alſo not obligatory; for, although</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are not obliged to pray (in ſuch, and ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,) yet if we do it, we are bound to pray</hi> debito modo <hi>in a dutiful way and manner.</hi> He adds more to this purpoſe, <hi>Num.</hi> 4. and <hi>Num.</hi> 5. concludes, that that vocal prayer, or ſpeaking to Almighty God which is made without mental attention is no prayer at all. Whence it follows that who prayes, muſt either at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to what he ſayes, or have his mind ſo devoutly elevated to Almighty God that his prayers prove ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable: for if that known Maxim be true, <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum cor non impetrat quod petit: a heart divided in prayer (that is, partly in Heaven, partly in earth) gets little,</hi> much more a heart which attends to no good thing when we pray, doth the work without fruit. Attention therefore is even neceſſary, actual, or virtual, whereof ſee <hi>Suarez</hi> Num. 7.</p>
            <p>To what the Doctor oppoſeth next after, thus: <hi>Nay, it is not neceſſary to the eſſence of prayer that he who prayes ſhould think</hi> de ipſa locutione, <hi>of the ſpeaking it ſelf. Suarez</hi> anſwers from his Number 15. to the end of the chapter. His diſcourſe is long, I'le therefore give you the ſubſtance of his reſolution by propoſing to our Doctor one or two queſtions. Suppoſe, Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> hath made to himſelf a ſet form of prayer which he knows moſt perfectly, and ſayes it before his Sermon, yet now and then ſurpriſed by an unvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary diſtraction thinks not <hi>de ipſa locutione.</hi> I aſk whither the fruit of ſuch prayer is loſt, and the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of it periſh? if he ſays yes, he ſpeaks a paradox, and muſt either conclude that few Miniſters pray to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107258:71"/> the purpoſe; or tell us a ſtrange ſtory, that they are never diſtracted in prayer.</p>
            <p>Yet more, ſuppoſe Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> while he ſaith his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, hath his mind ſo deeply fixed on Almighty God that (though his tongue ſpeaks) he thinks not of the ſpeaking, but of God onely, and his immenſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Will he alſo ſay that his prayer is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Tis impious to think it. Now hear <hi>Suarez</hi> at the end of his 17. number, and obſerve how he is abuſed. <hi>Non eſt,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>de ratione orationis, ut cogitet orans de ipſa locutione, ſed, ſatis eſt ſi cogitet de Deo cum quo loquitur. 'Tis, not of the eſsence of prayer to think of the ſpeaking, but it is enough that he who prayes think of Almighty God with whom he ſpeaks;</hi> for <hi>here is aſcenſio mentis ad Deum the lifting up of our heart to God,</hi> therefore true prayer. This of prayer in general, for thoſe who have a ſet forme of prayer preſcribed, (as Prieſts have) <hi>Suarez</hi> num. 19. requires a decent attention to the words, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Wiſe man. <hi>Ne temerè quid lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaris &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt not quite omit that other cavil of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; <hi>It is not neceſſary</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>out of Suarez to think of the things ſignified by the words. Anſw.</hi> God forbid it ſhould be neceſſary; for if our Doctor ſhould pray <hi>for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim and Thummim, and to have</hi>
               <note place="margin">Such is the dark Language of D. <hi>Taylor</hi> and D. <hi>Pierce.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>his tongue touch'd with a coal from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and that God would bleſs him, and his, from that Empuſe that met</hi> Apollonius Tyanaeus, <hi>and all remnants of embrodery from the</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opneuſt Aholiah, <hi>and finally from the pride of Popes ſtigmatiz'd by a prolepſis:</hi> Few I believe, and very few who pray with him, would think (becauſe they
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:107258:72"/> underſtand not) of the things ſignified by theſe words, Yet, they pray, or do not pray: <hi>Anguſtiae undique.</hi> If the firſt: poor people may pray though they know not the thing ſignified by words. If they do not pray, all is vanity when they kneel down at ſuch a prayer, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to it. The Doctor may ſay, they uſe no ſuch language in prayer. <hi>Anſ.</hi> They uſe worſe in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, witneſs Dr. <hi>Pierce's late Sermon,</hi> whereof, part at leaſt might by ſome induſtrie be turned into a long prayer, with all its pedantry and vain affectation. If ſo; I ſeriouſly aſk whether a hundred old women, who heard ſuch a prayer, ſaid at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, and pray according to the ſence of it; pray, or no? if they do, old women may pray when they underſtand not things ſignify'd by words: if they do not, they pray not, yet ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to all.</p>
            <p>I dare a vouch it with certainty, that there is not a Cobler, or Taylor in our Catholick Town here, who do not better underſtand the whole ſubſtance of <hi>Maſs,</hi> (though in <hi>Latin,</hi>) then the generality of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men underſtand Dr. <hi>Pierce's</hi> Sermon. Yet 'tis printed for the profit of all. Be it ſo or not, I juſtify by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple now given, and good reaſon againſt the Doctor, that prayer in an unknown Language though the thing ſignified by the words be not perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, is allowable, and looſes nothing of the eſſence of prayer: I prove it thus.</p>
            <p>Such a prayer known by the authority of the Church, and conſent of virtuous men to be good and pious, (though in an unknown Language,) may be offered up by an ignorant man, both to praiſe Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, and to petition his Divine Majeſty for a grace and favour; juſt as one not knowing Latin,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:107258:72"/> may prefer a Petition to the Pope in that Language, which containes both praiſe due to ſo great a Prelat, and withall begg's a boon or favour of him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is our very Caſe. The unlearned man knows not perfectly the Latin Service; no more doth this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Suppliant know his Latin Petition. The firſt is aſſured by the greateſt authority imaginable, that the Latin Service aſcribes prayſe and thanks-giving to God, and begg's a favour of him; The ſecond is aſſured, ('tis true by a leſſer authority,) that his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition runs on in the like nature; if therefore this man who knows not Latin, may petition (and with hope of grace) a Pope, or Prince in Latin; never ſhall the Doctor ſhew why an ignorant man may not alſo petition Almighty God in the ſame Language; let the Doctor here give me but a ſhadow of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity, and he ſhall be an <hi>Apollo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were it not over tedious, I might give you (with the learned <hi>Suarez</hi>) the true reaſon of this doctrin; briefly in words or writings, you may diſtinguiſh a twofold ſignification. The firſt is more general, the ſecond may be called <hi>ſpecifical,</hi> or if you pleaſe <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual.</hi> The general ſignification is had, when we know that ſuch a prayer is good, pious, and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: But to have perfectly the ſpecifical, we muſt know the ſenſe and meaning of the words. To pray therefore well, this knowledge is required, that the prayer is a good and pious petition, and as ſuch, (u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting my ſelf with all faithful Chriſtians) I offer it up to Almighty God, though I comprehend not the ultimate <hi>ſpecifical</hi> or <hi>individual</hi> ſignification of it. May not I beſeech you our Doctor ſay thoſe words of the Royal Prophet <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. and prayſe Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:107258:73"/> God by them; <hi>Si dormiatis inter medios cleros pennae columbae deargentatae</hi> &amp;c. Though perhaps he knows not perfectly the ſpecifical ſignification of them? Yes, and ſo may an old woman do, when ſhe hears her Miniſter pray for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim, or to have his tongue touch'd with a coal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Add to this, (and 'tis worth reflection,) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the general knowledge poor Idiots have of the piety in Latin Service, innumerable by continual uſe come to a ſpecifical knowledge of moſt things ſaid in holy Maſs: and more your poor Idiots in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> know not, either of thoſe wordy extemporal prayers made by Miniſters, or of their affected and fruitleſs Sermons. No <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> no <hi>Ambros,</hi> no <hi>Auſtin</hi> ever preach'd or pray'd like them. But what will you? Novelty in doctrin brings with it theſe <hi>new nothings</hi> in morality.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The Doctor yet holds on in quoting Authours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs. His Errors are diſcovered.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Doctor next cites you <hi>Salmeron</hi> ſaying, <hi>that prayers prevail when they are not underſtood like the words of a charmer.

Well, but admit S. <hi>Antoninus</hi> ſay ſo, there is nothing reprehenſible: The ſimilitude is good, if the unſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man knows as well in general, that he hath a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſtone in his hand, as the unlearned man that his prayer is pious.</p>
            <p>The Doctor pag. 118 remits us to <hi>Jacobus de Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiis de orat. Anſw.</hi> I have 3.

            <pb n="144" facs="tcp:107258:74"/>
            <p>Immediatly after he quotes Cardinal <hi>Tolet lib. 2. de inſtruct.

            </p>
            <p>Mark now a moſt ſtrange illation of our Doctor, <hi>ſo that,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by this doctrin no attention is neceſsary. Tolet</hi> ſayes, <hi>We are to ſay our Canonical hours attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, devoutly, and reverently,</hi> and the Doctor infers; that <hi>no attention is neceſſary.</hi> Whether ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy dealing, with ſo learned a man as <hi>Tolet</hi> was, be tollerable, let the world judge.</p>
            <p>The Doctor pag. 120. would even tire a patient man with his tattle. <hi>They in England,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>pray with the heart, We</hi> (the Church of <hi>Rome) with our lips, They pray, We ſay prayers,</hi> &amp;c. And what good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor do we ſay them without a heart? who made you judge of this <hi>forum?</hi> The ſecrets of hearts are only known to God, (not to Angles) much leſs to any poor <hi>ſpirit</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> What follows in that 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is onely talk without ſubſtance. And,</p>
            <p>Truly his. 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Section is like it; though worſe, for blaſphemies againſt the Mother of God, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saints in Heaven. The Doctor about pag. 33. tells us, that Scripture expreſly forbids us to enquire of the dead, but here he is more then inquiſitive, for he takes upon him to judge, to degrade, and caſt out of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107258:74"/> Heaven many a happy ſoul; witneſs his pag. 133. I paſs by his jeers, and blaſphemies, (they are all num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by one that errs not,) and take notice only of two or three quotations.</p>
            <p>Pag. 124. he cites you S. <hi>Antoninus Sum. part. 4. tit. 15. without either chapter, number, or further dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Whereas that 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. title,</hi> in an old cloſe abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated character, contains about 60. whole leaves in <hi>folio,</hi> which if printed in ſuch a letter as the Doctors <hi>Diſsuaſive</hi> is, would well make two, or more of it. I chiefly doubt whether S. <hi>Antoninus</hi> be fairly dealt with, cited for theſe words. <hi>How ſhall a ſinner go to Christ as to an advocate?</hi> but cannot now run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo large a Treatiſe to find the truth. In the interim the Doctor may bluſh to paint his margent with ſuch confuſed quotations. A child may ſee, he either read not <hi>Antoninus,</hi> or, minded not his Reader ſhould meet with the place.</p>
            <p>Soon after he cites <hi>F. Salazar in cap. 8. Proverb. in ver.</hi> 19. Saying, <hi>that the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>by offering up Chriſt was worthy to have, (after a certain manner) that the whole ſalvation and redemption of mankind ſhould be aſcribed to her, and that this was common to Chriſt and the Virgin.

            </argument>
            <p>MUch patience I confeſs is neceſſary to read our Doctor, and more to loſe time in weighing his unweighty arguments. Yet go on we muſt. In his 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section therefore, page chiefly 123. He tyres you with a few old trivial objections againſt <hi>invocation of Saints,</hi> made long ſince by others, &amp;, God knows, anſwer'd by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> before the Doctor was born, though he talks, as if they were the <hi>new Lights</hi> of his own learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, never thought on by any body elſe. He argues firſt, <hi>We have no command, no teſtimony, no promiſe in Scripture for the invocation of Saints. Bellarmin</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers <hi>Tom. 2. de Sanctorum Beatit. lib. 1. cap 20. §. argumentum ſextum;</hi> and ſaith well, <hi>the argument proves too much, viz.</hi> That Saints cannot pray in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral for the good of the Church, which yet Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants grant. He argues. 2. <hi>prayer to Saints leſſens our honour to Chriſt, deſtroys our confidence in God. Anſw.</hi> If ſo, we cannot pray for one another here on earth, without leſſening Chriſts honour, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our confidence towards God. See <hi>Bellar. lib. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato cap. 20. §. argumentum ſecundum &amp; cap. 19. §. preterea in utroque teſtamento.</hi> He objects 3. <hi>We cannot know how our prayers come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Saints in Heaven.

I think the Doctor will not deny, that the bleſſed ſoul of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hears our prayers (I ſpeak of his ſanctified created ſoul, not of his Divinity every where preſent,) if this can be explicated, all difficulty ceaſeth; well may both Saints &amp; Angels in heaven hear our prayers. He ſaith 4. <hi>We give Saints too high titles.

               </gap>ights the practice of common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have recourſe to Saints for their temporal goods; make their addreſſes to them for health, ſeek their Patronage, &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was doubtleſs ſome good congruous thought that withheld our Doctor from ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ighting alſo that poor <hi>Taylor</hi> of <hi>Hippo,</hi> by name <hi>Florentius,</hi> who having loſt his Cloak, had not wherewithall to buy an other: What did he? <hi>Ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginti Martyres,</hi> &amp;c. he prayed <hi>before</hi> the twenty <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and begged with a loud voice that he might
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107258:76" rendition="simple:additions"/> be clothed, ſome young men heard him, and ſcorned the good <hi>Taylor,</hi> (as our Doctor doth here vulgar people) yet his prayer proved ſucceſſeful, heard he was, and his want miraculouſly ſupplied. This you may read in S. <hi>Austin lib. 22. de civit. Dei. cap. 8. circa medium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence I argue, if this poor man, by addreſſing himſelf to deceaſed <hi>Martyrs</hi> for a cloak prayed wel, and laudably, yes, and by ſuch prayers got what he aſked; moſt blameleſs certainly are the common people, while they petition any Saint in Heaven for their temporal goods, (whether ſheep, or oxen it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports not) or, if the Doctor jeer'd at theſe mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, he may, if he like it alſo play the boy, and laugh at the <hi>Taylor,</hi> S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did not ſo. And,</p>
            <p>Here, without much digreſſing, reflect I beſeech you on that witty margent note Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> hath in his book againſt <hi>S C.</hi> pag. 292. where, to diſcredit this known miracle, he ſpeaks thus. <hi>Further let it be conſidered that here we have no better preſident then a Taylor, and he ſo ſimple, as to bargain with the Martyrs, how many half-pence he would have to buy his cloak.</hi> Subtilely obſerved, for firſt there is not a word in S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> of the poor mans bargaining with the Martyrs, unleſs his earneſt prayer be called a bargain. Secondly Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> ſaith <hi>in his context</hi> that the <hi>Taylor</hi> prayed not to the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> but to God at the tomb of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> if therefore he bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any, it was with God for ſo many half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. Thirdly he ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ights this miracle upon the account of the <hi>Taylors</hi> ſimplicity, as if, (forſooth) God could do wonders on none but the Learned, or Doctors of Divinity. Fourthly and chiefly, he is pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107258:77"/> out every way, for no one takes this miracle upon the <hi>Taylors</hi> credit, but upon S. <hi>Auſtins,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it as a wonder done in behalf of this poor man, and ſo we credit what he adds of the <hi>Cook</hi> that opening the fiſh, found a gold ring in it, and pittying the diſtreſſed Suppliant gave it him with, <hi>ecce quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do viginti Martyres te veſtiverunt: See how the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Martyrs have clothed thee.</hi> And thus much of good peoples devotion to Saints for temporals. Now if you further inquire, not only after the recourſe made by devout Chriſtians to the bleſſed<note place="margin">See <hi>Bellar.</hi> cap. 20. <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra. § Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum nonu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>

S. <hi>Fingar</hi> (though ſome ſay) S. <hi>Anſelm</hi> accounted him a bleſſed man was never yet canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and I wonder what our Doctor hath againſt S. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> of whom little is known.

Our Doctor deals not wel with his Reader, for he ſhould for <hi>Beſſarions</hi> aſſertion have remitted him to the Cardinals own book, and not to <hi>Bodinus.</hi> or <hi>Iohn Pudding,</hi> a man of Atheiſtical Principles, whoſe authority with the judicious is altogether as little as the Doctor's. <hi>Bodinus</hi> his <hi>Republick</hi> I have, but yet cannot get a ſight of his <hi>Method.

            <p>Next he cites <hi>Augustinus Triumphus de Ancona</hi> affirming, <hi>that all, who are canonized by the Pope, cannot be ſaid to be in Heaven.</hi> And where find we this aſſertion of <hi>Triumphus?</hi> in two places, anſwers our Doctor, viz. <hi>quaeſt. 14. ad quartum,</hi> and <hi>quaest. 17. ad quartum.</hi> Obſerve here the Doctors ignorance; For, (to ſay nothing of his unſkilfull omitting the Article) theſe two quotations <hi>ad quartum</hi> are the Authours Objections, not his reſolution. The reſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lution follows, no way aſſerting what the Doctor ſaith, but contrary thus: <hi>That the Pope, in canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing a Saint by the exterior evidence he hath of his Sanctity, cannot err; Although, ſaith this Authour, neither Pope, nor Church can know certainly, per certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem cauſae, by the certainty of the cauſe, that all canonized poſseſs beatitude.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>per certitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem cauſae,</hi> becauſe God, who only endues a Soul
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:107258:80"/> with Charity <hi>cauſaliter,</hi> is only conſcious, that it is enriched with this gift.

Thus <hi>Anconitanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To what the Doctor adds of ſome reputed Saints for a time, and afterwards burnt for Hereticks.

            <p>The Doctor ends his ninth Section pag. 134. with a pittifull complaint againſt the multitude of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſaith out of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantus, that there are about two hundred Holy dayes in the whole year, which is an intolerable burthen to the poor labourer, that on the rest he can ſcarce earn his bread, beſides much ſuperſtition and licentiouſneſs that fellows ſuch diſorderly feſtivities. Anſw.</hi> The ignorance of our Doctor is more then intolerable, who neither underſtands <hi>Gavantus,</hi> nor the practice of our Church. Strange it is, that he alſo complained not of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107258:81"/> faſting dayes anſwerable to theſe holydayes, much weakning the labouring man, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the year hath more faſts and feaſts in it, then dayes: This later is as true, as what the Doctor tells us of two hundred holydayes. Let him therefore know, that all theſe holydayes which <hi>Gavantus</hi> calls feaſts, or are placed in the Calender <hi>in red letters,</hi> are not dayes of precept, obliging poor labourers to deſiſt from ſervile work, but are ſtyled feaſts upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that the Church keeps a memory of ſo many bleſſed Saints in order with Office, and Maſs. More then the moſt of them hinder no manual work, nor lay any obligation on the labouring man. Hence his argument of eaſe and licentiouſneſs accompanying theſe feſtivities is made null. Only thus much it proves, that one may innocently ſmile at the Doctors ſkill in what he writes againſt.</p>

            <p>And firſt, it is an eternal ſhame for a Doctor of Divinity to rayl with open mouth againſt all Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm's, ſeeing we are aſcertain'd, that not only Chriſt our Lord impowered his own Diſciples to caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, but the Ancient Church likewiſe poſſitively preſcribed a Form of Exorciſm. This we have in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> celebrated in the year, 398. (and approved by <hi>Leo</hi> the third) <hi>cap. 7. Exorciſta</hi> (ſaith the Council) <hi>cum ordinatur, accipiat de manu Epiſcopi libellum in quo Scripti ſunt Exorciſmi, dicente ſibi Epiſcopo: Accipe, &amp; commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da memoriae, &amp; habeto poteſtatem imponendi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ſuper energumenum, ſive baptizatum, ſive Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumenum. Let the Exorciſt when he is ordained, take a book from the hand of the Biſhop, wherein the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſms are writ; the Biſhop ſaying, take this Book, and commit it to memory, and receive power to lay thy hands upon the poſſeſſed perſon, whether Baptized, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumen.</hi> Thus ſaid the Ancient Church, even when our Proteſtants ſay it was without error; yet now up ſtarts a new faſhioned Doctor in a corner of the world brim full of anger, and muſt needs vent it againſt theſe ſacred rites: Exorciſm's, (forſooth) with him, are <hi>horible impiety,</hi> a <hi>Conjugation of evils, Incantations, Diabolical charms,</hi> and what not? Well, for adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Devils, and caſting them out of poſſeſſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we have both the Practice, and Authority of the moſt Ancient Fathers that ever lived in the Church. I'le give you a few, and, for others, remit you to <hi>Pamelius</hi> his notes upon <hi>Tertullian de Baptiſmo, pag.</hi> (with me) 468. printed at <hi>Antwerp, Anno 1584. daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tertullian in his Apologet, adv.

Let the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſpeak out, and tell us plainly if he dares with any conſcience ſay that all this is nothing but <hi>Diabolical charming, and horrible impiety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would he pleaſe to credit me, I might tell him a true ſtory of a certain man who had his houſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably haunted with evil Spirits; much affliction they gave both to his Servants and Cattle. To be ſhort he called for a Prieſt, and begged him to pray in his houſe, who did ſo; he ſaid Maſs, offered up the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſts ſacred body, and prayed very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly that that trouble might ceaſe. His prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, ceaſe it did. Yet more; This good man had from a friend ſome of that holy earth which was brought from <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> where our Lotd <hi>Jeſus</hi> was buried, and this he hung up in his chamber to ſecure himſelf from danger of theſe evil Spirits. This is the ſtory; and will the Doctor believe it on my word? No, he laughs at it; it ſmells ſaith he, of Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that offering up of Chriſts body ſacrificed, and keeping that earth ſhould free the mans chamber from Devils, is plain Popery ſavouring too much of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody Sacrifice, and the doctrin of relicks, &amp;c. I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107258:83"/> grant all (except the Superſtition) and tell the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, he muſt either credit the ſtory, or diſcredit S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> who relates it in his 22. book <hi>de civitate (An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerp</hi> print anno 1676. cap 8. page 297.

            <p>Theſe truths ſuppoſed (which no Proteſtant can anſwer) I will with licenſe inquire of our Doctor what it is he finds fault with in our Catholick Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſins againſt Devils? Is it the power we have from Chriſt <hi>Jeſus</hi> to caſt them out of perſons poſſeſſed, or places haunted by them? The very authority of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers already alledged, and the continued favour of Almighty God to this our age, in aſſiſting many (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of the Catholick Church) to diſpoſſeſs innumerable poſſeſſed, proves the power, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth moſt undeniably the effects of it. Known Hiſtory for thoſe wonders done in later ages, and yet living ey-witneſſes in our dayes, gain credit with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men, and juſtly may conquer a greater increduty then the Doctor harbours in his breaſt. All cannot be fiction nor the Authors proved lyars that writ ſuch ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet more.</p>
            <pb n="163" facs="tcp:107258:83"/>
            <p>Doth our Doctor reprehend the words we uſe in Exorciſms? Yes. And why? Is it becauſe they are adjurative? If ſo, the Fathers now cited are our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and will ſilence the Doctor. Is it becauſe they are words unuſual, and not eaſily underſtood by all? If this offend him, I anſwer firſt; that there are more unuſual pedantick words in one Dr <hi>Pierces</hi> Sermon then in all the approved Exorciſms of the Catholick Church; yet that Sermon is for the people, theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſms are againſt the Devil, who better underſtands the hardeſt terme in them, then the generality of men that Sermon. I anſwer 2. that in the <hi>Roman ritual,</hi> (which we chiefly defend) not one word can be thought unuſual; it is plain Latin all a long, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to the pooreſt Schollar. The like I ſay of that <hi>Manual of Exorciſms</hi> printed at <hi>Antwerp anno</hi> 1626. which our Doctor cauſeleſly cavils at pag. 136. the like of the <hi>Exorciſms</hi> for <hi>the Dioces of Iper, printed at S. Omers anno</hi> 1606.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe I have by me two other Exorciſms, the one printed at <hi>Venice</hi> 1579. the other anno 1585. in an old Character. The book is called <hi>Sacerdotale Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum;</hi> towards the end of theſe Editions you have the Exorciſm, and both Hebrew and Greek thus in Latin Letters. <hi>Adjuro vos per nomina omnipotentis Dei, Meſſias, Sother, Emanuel, Sabaoth, Adonias,</hi> I adjure you by the names, &amp;c. And this perhaps made our Doctor pag. 138. exclaim againſt ſome Exorciſms for their <hi>falſe Hebrew and baſe Greek.</hi> Sure the good man thought that <hi>Meſſias</hi> and <hi>Sother</hi> ſhould have been a genitive caſe becauſe of <hi>Omnipotentis Dei,</hi> whereas they relate to the precedent words <hi>per nomina;</hi> as if one ſhould ſay <hi>per nomen Jeremias adjuro, by your
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107258:84"/> name Jeremy, I adjure you,</hi> never to cavil without cauſe. Like cavils about Letters,, and writing <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> without the Hebrew twang, <hi>Sother</hi> leſs correctedly, &amp;c. I omit; and tell the Doctor that a poor Pariſh Prieſt ſhall do more againſt the Devil with this he calls <hi>falſe Hebrew, and baſe Greek,</hi> then twenty Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in <hi>England</hi> with the moſt quaint extemporal prayers they can make.</p>
            <p>What elſe remains reprehenſible in theſe exorciſms? The Doctor anſwers pag. 141. <hi>Superſtition</hi> (a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous evil doubtleſs; Wel. I'le deale plainly and licenſe the Doctor to make uſe of any definition, which, either ancient Father, or new approved wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters give us of Superſtition (we will ſtand to his choice) yet I'le aſſure him he ſhall never ſo much as touch Catholicks with the leaſt likelihood of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition in their exorciſms. What <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaith of Superſtition <hi>lib. 4. de inſt. cap. 28. initio: qui Deos precabantur, &amp; immolabant ut ſui ſibi filij ſuperſtites eſſent, ſuperſtitioſi ſunt appellati,</hi> concerns not exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms at all, and leſs doth that known one of <hi>Cicero lib. 2. de natura Deorum, qui pro ſuperſtiti prole ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mij erant in Dijs precandis,</hi> &amp;c. touch them; if the Doctor therefore pleaſe, we will ſay, that Superſtition is, <hi>Cultus indebitus, ſeu vana religio. A wrong, vain, and incongruous worſhip, which look's like religion, but is not.</hi> And next let us read any approved exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. The prayers made there to Almighty God are Acts of Religion, and neither wrong, nor incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip. The calling on God by ſeveral names we find in Scripture, cannot be judged by a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, vain or incongruous. The reading of <hi>Davids Pſalms,</hi> and the Goſpels of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt is not in vain.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107258:84"/> The adjuring of <hi>Devils</hi> is warranted by Fathers, and the power of caſting them out is given by <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt. Where then lyes the danger of vain worſhip, or ſo much as the leaſt ſigne of any Superſtition? If the word <hi>exorciſm</hi> diſpleaſe our Doctor, we have it, (to ſay nothing of others) in S. <hi>Austin lib. 1. de peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum meritis, &amp; remiſſione cap. 34. initio and lib. 6. contra Julianum cap</hi> 5. with an exſufflation added in Baptiſm. <hi>Filios fidelium</hi> (ſaith the S.) <hi>nec exorci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaret, nec exſufflaret,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Church would neither exorciſe, nor breath on little Children, were it not to free them from the power of darkneſs, and Prince of death.</hi> Let the Doctor ſay what he thinks of this <hi>exſufflation;</hi> if ſuch a Ceremony be not Superſtition, none in our exorciſms can be; if the ſign of the Croſs frights him, he may know, 'tis allowed by all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and Bleſſed S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> thus <hi>Tom. 4. lib. uno de catech. rudibus cap.</hi> 20. a little after the beginning. <hi>Crucis ſigno infronte hodie tanquam in poſte ſignandus es, omnesque Chriſtiani ſignatur, Little ones and all Chriſtians are ſigned with the ſigne of the Croſs.</hi> And what, beſides the things now mentioned, can be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable in our approved exorciſms? I ſay <hi>approved;</hi> for, if any other, either is, or hath been extant, juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprehenſible, we defend it not. The anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing the Devil by the name of <hi>Beelzebub, Satan,</hi> (or any other we have in Scripture) is no more Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then to call an open Rebel, <hi>Traitor:</hi> neither can the caſting of his picture into the fire, (if any exorciſt does it) be thought an action more ſuperſtitious then to hang a Traitor up in <hi>effigie,</hi> when his perſon is out of reach; hanging is for the one, burning is for the other.

The power given by Chriſt our Lord to his Church for the caſting out of Devils is our warrant. The definitions of Councils, preſcribing a form of Exorciſm, how to caſt them out, are our warrant. The Authority of the Graveſt Fathers that ever lived, approving the conjuration of Devils, is our warrant. Their diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the enchantments of Heathens, Incantations, Witchery, and theſe pious Exorciſms, is our warrant. The practice of the Church, and uſe of theſe conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in all Ages, is our warrant. The wonders God hath done by Exorciſms, (both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authours relate them) are our warrant. Moſt aſſured, and certain experience in theſe our dayes, that Devils are caſt out of poſſeſſed perſons, is our warrant. What then remaines but that we retort the Argument, and tell our Doctor, if after ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, manifeſt, and undeniable proofs, (that theſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107258:85"/> Exorciſms come from God) He unworthily decrys them, let him ſhew his warrant, and anſwer my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But this he ſhall never do while by opening only one <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or a <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> (to ſay nothing of others) I can <hi>conjure</hi> him to ſilence.</p>
            <p>In the interim, I would know of our Doctor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thinks there are, or have been in this our age, perſons poſſeſſed of Devils? If he ſays no, moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt experience (of Devils ſpeaking in an unknown tongue, of their violent torturing a body, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it above all force of nature, &amp;c,) prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Again, Anciently there were theſe <hi>Energu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni,</hi> and very numerous. And why not now? are any Devils dead ſince that time? or leſs malitious now then anciently? are men in theſe dayes better ſecured from them then the primitive Chriſtians? <hi>Toyes.</hi> Nothing is probable. Therefore the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor muſt confeſs, if, he'l deal ingeniouſly, that there are ſometimes theſe <hi>Energumeni.</hi> All cannot be ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that authors write of poſſeſſed perſons, and if ſome onely be true, moſt deplorable is the condition of ſuch as are truly poſſeſſed; who, deſtitute of comfort (if old Papiſts help not) may ſigh, and groan under their miſery: relief they can have none from Dr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> (who oppoſes all Exorciſms) and as little from his fellow Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> for few among them that ever yet I heard of who either dare encounter a Devil in a poſſeſſed body, or if they doe it, they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unlucky Exorciſts, for they never give poor ſufferers any eaſe.</p>
            <p>The other Objection that our Doctor hath (<hi>pag.</hi> 141.) is taken out of <hi>Origen. Tract. 35. in Matth.</hi> and 'tis the onely thing in ſubſtance I find in this tenth
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107258:86"/> Section, though I will aſſure the Reader (having peruſed three Editions of <hi>Origen.</hi>) that the Doctor both omits in the words he gives you, what Origen hath; and afterward, conceals what may ſerve for an Explication, if <hi>Origen,</hi> deſerve it, for ſome ſay he erred in this place; ſo <hi>Baronius ad annum Chriſti, 56. n.</hi> 4. in the <hi>Antwerp</hi> print 1612. others with <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> incline to think that theſe Treatiſes on S. <hi>Matth.</hi> (as the 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> is not) are not <hi>Origens, viz. Bellar. de Scriptorib. Eccleſias.</hi> However I'le give you <hi>Origens</hi> own words (in the <hi>Baſil print, anno 1571.) pag.</hi> 187. uttered on this occaſion, that the Prince of the <hi>Jews</hi> adjured our Saviour, whereupon he makes a Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thus. <hi>Quaeret aliquis ſi convenit vel daemones adjurare? Some</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>may ask whether it be meet to adjure Devils?</hi> Then adds, <hi>Et qui reſpicit ad mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos qui talia facere auſi ſint, dicet, non ſine ratione fieri. And he who looks on the practice of many that dare to do ſo, will ſay, 'tis done not without reaſon</hi> (theſe words our Doctor omits totally) <hi>Origen.</hi> goes on (and here is the onely difficulty) <hi>qui autem aſpicit Jeſum imperantem doemonibus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds Jeſus commanding Devils, and giving power to his Diſciples over them, and to heal diſeaſes, will ſay; that to adjure Devils, is not according to the power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by our Saviour. Judaicum est enim. For its Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical.</hi> Thus <hi>Origen;</hi> And here ends our Doctor, concealing what follows immediately thus. <hi>Hoc, &amp; ſi aliquando a noſtris tale aliquid fiat, ſimile fit ei, quod a Solomone Scriptis adjurationibus, ſolent daemones ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurari,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This</hi> (Judaical adjuration) <hi>if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time any ſuch thing be done by our men, is like that, which Devils are wont to be adjured with, out of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107258:86"/> written adjurations of</hi> Solomon. <hi>Sed &amp; ipſi qui utuntur adjurationibus illis aliquoties nec idoneis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutis libris utuntur. But even they who uſe theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurations at ſome time uſe not right Books. Quibus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam autem &amp; de Hebraeo acceptis adjurant daemonia: Taking certain things out of the Hebrew they adjure Devils.</hi> Hitherto you have faithfully <hi>Origens</hi> words, and his whole Context in order; which in rigor (all circumſtances well weighed) only condemn Judaical conjurations, or ſuch Books (not allowable) vitiated perhaps with Jewiſh Exorciſms. For moſt certain it is that the <hi>Jews</hi> had their Exorciſts; and that their power of caſting out Devils ceaſed at the beginning of Chriſtian Religion, or ſoon after: read <hi>Acts</hi> the 19. <hi>v.</hi> 13. Certain it is alſo, if we believe <hi>Joſephus</hi> the <hi>Jew, lib. 8. de antiquitate, cap.</hi> 2. (with me, <hi>folio 68. verſus finem</hi>) that <hi>Solomon</hi> had his Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms compoſed, as ſome moſt Learned are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, after his fall into Idolatry. Theſe and ſuch like adjurations <hi>Origen</hi> reproves, and not any Chriſtian Catholick Exorciſm.</p>
            <p>My reaſon is, firſt, that <hi>Origen</hi> contradicted not Fathers more ancient then himſelf; ſuch were <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> above cited; theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Devils, therefore <hi>Origen</hi> might do ſo. 2. <hi>Lib. 1. contra Celſum</hi> with me (in the Edition above named) <hi>pag.</hi> 637. He profeſſedly acknowledgeth the power of caſting out Devils given to Chriſtians; yes, and after he had taxed <hi>Celſus</hi> of injuſtice, and open ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, for aſcribing their ejection done by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to Incantations and Sorcery. He anſwers thus; <hi>n. 6. Non enim incantationibus pollere videntur, ſed nomine Jeſu, cum commemoratione ejus factorum;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107258:87"/> nam, his verbis ſaepenumero profligati ſunt daemones ex hominibus.</hi> That is, <hi>Chriſtians do nothing in this matter by any Charms, or Enchantments, but prevail against Devils by naming Chriſt Jeſus, and commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating his glorious works. Thus theſe wicked ſpirits are driven out of poſſeſſed perſons;</hi> And truly the like we do yet in our Catholick adjurations. 3. It is madneſs to think, that one ſo well verſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Origen</hi> was, had ſuch a horror of this word <hi>Adjuro,</hi> that he judged it unſeemly in the mouth of a Chriſtian; for the Apoſtle himſelf uſeth it, writing to the <hi>Theſs. Epiſt. 1. cap. 5. v. 27. Adjuro vos per domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ut legatur Epiſtola haec. I adjure ye by our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And mark, it is a word of command, <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Yes, and the ſame that the Devil uſed againſt our Saviour, <hi>Mar. 5. v. 7. Adjuro te per De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>I adjure thee by Almighty God.</hi> Briefly therefore diſtinguiſh a double adjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the one of no Efficacy, becauſe either vain or <hi>Judaical;</hi> and this <hi>Origen</hi> rejecteth; The other is Chriſtian uſed in our Catholick Exorciſms, with the ſacred Name of Jeſus; and this he approves. The Doctor may object that <hi>Origen,</hi> ſpeaking of the High Prieſt adjuring our Saviour, makes this Argument; <hi>Si enim jurare non licet, quia nec alterum adjurare li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet. If it be not lawful to ſwear, neither lawful is it to adjure another.</hi> I anſwer; This confirms all we have ſaid hitherto in <hi>Origens</hi> defence. For, as none can judge that ſo great a Doctor as <hi>Origen,</hi> condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all ſwearing, which God allowes in Scripture: [<hi>Vivit Dominus. Jurabit Dominus. Per nomen ejus jurabis,</hi> &amp;c.] but only ſuch as is irreligious and profane. So none can infer upon this proof, that he thought
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107258:87"/> all adjuration illicit; though he profeſſedly oppoſed irreligious and Judaical Exorciſms. Thus much in behalf of <hi>Origen,</hi> if theſe Treatiſes on S. <hi>Mat.</hi> be his; for <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in the preface to them, ſaith, <hi>Neque enim Hieronimus agnoſcit hoc opus. S. Hierom acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth them not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor, <hi>pag.</hi> 142. having done with <hi>Origen,</hi> quotes S. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> for this <hi>ſober ſaying, we poor wretches cannot drive away flies, much leſs Devils.</hi> And remits you to the Saint, <hi>in illa verba qui credit in me major a faciet.</hi> I anſwer, that S. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> may perhaps have theſe words, <hi>qui credit in me,</hi> &amp;c. 40. times over in his Large and Voluminous writings; Muſt I therefore run over all theſe Tomes, to meet with this <hi>ſober ſaying;</hi> for moſt certainly it is not where any Reader would expect to have it, I mean in S. <hi>Chriſoſtoms 73. hom. in cap. 14. Joan.</hi> there are the words of Scripture, <hi>qui credit in me,</hi> &amp;c. And S. <hi>Chriſoſtoms</hi> large Explication on them; but not ſo much as one ſyllable of either Flie or <hi>Devil,</hi> or any <hi>poor wretch unable to caſt out Devils,</hi> but much to the contrary. <hi>Hoc veſtrum jam eſt,</hi> ſaith the Saint, <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racula operari, ego abeo. It belongs to you</hi> (my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) <hi>to work miracles, I am now on my departure.</hi> The <hi>Chriſoſtom I cite</hi> is the <hi>Paris</hi> print, <hi>anno</hi> 1588. his Comments on the words <hi>qui credit,</hi> &amp;c. are page 293. and other Editions accord alſo with it, even the Greek by Sir <hi>Henry Savil.</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>The bleſſing of Water prov'd by Irrefragable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Of Miracles done by Holy Water. No proof againſt it.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Doctor, pag. 143. and 11 <hi>Section</hi> thinks with a few empty words, and a like number of inſipid jeers to unhollow ſuch Creatures, as the moſt ancient Fathers of Gods Church have reputed holy, becauſe made ſo with a ſacred benediction. Such are <hi>Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Paſchal Candle, Oyl,</hi> and <hi>Holy Bread,</hi> ſleighted by him, without proof at all. Truely I am aſtoniſhed at our Doctor (having at leaſt) read <hi>Bellarmin de cultu Sanct. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 7. and peruſed the Arguments of this Learned Authour, for the bleſſing of <hi>Water, Oyl,</hi> &amp;c. That he neither affords us ſo much as a word of anſwer to the Arguments, nor yet endeavours to gainſay them by one Syllable of Scripture, by any Authority of Councils, of Fathers, or the Antient practice of the Primitive Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmin</hi> firſt proves out of Scripture, that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are capable of benediction; <hi>Every Creature is good,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. 1. <hi>ad Tim. 4. Sanctificatur autem per verbum Dei, &amp; orationem: And is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Word of God, and Prayer.</hi> He ſhowes you alſo out of S. <hi>Dennis, Alexander</hi> the firſt, <hi>Optatus,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and others, that Water anciently was bleſſed in the Church. The like of <hi>Oyl,</hi> by the Authority of S. <hi>Clement, Dennis,</hi> and <hi>Baſil.</hi> The benediction of Bread (beſides the Euchariſt) is taught
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107258:88"/> by S. <hi>Auſtin, Tom. 7. lib. 2. De peccatorum meritis &amp; remiſſione, cap.</hi> 26. ſpeaking of the Catechumens. <hi>Et quod accipiunt,</hi> (ſaith the Saint) <hi>quamvis non ſit Corpus Chriſti, Sanctum eſt tamen, &amp; ſanctius quam cibi quibus alimur. And what theſe Catechumens take, although it be not Chriſts Body, yet it is holy, yes, and more holy then the meat wherewith we are nouriſhed.</hi> Hence I argue, if Bread can be hallowed, Water may; And this I prove by three irrefragable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The firſt is taken out of the Ancient <hi>Syneſius,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Ptolemaijs,</hi> or <hi>Cyrene,</hi> in his book printed at <hi>Paris, anno</hi> 1633. (we have it alſo in <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum</hi>) read theſe words in that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe he intitles <hi>Cataſtaſis,</hi>

Ile place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me the hallowed Veſsels of Water, there Ile ſit alive, and ly when I am dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet more, read his 121. <hi>Epiſtle to Anaſtaſius, pag.</hi> 258. If, ſaith <hi>Sineſius,</hi> the Adminiſtration of the Common-wealth reſides in Biſhops; theſe are the men that muſt do juſtice on wickedneſs. <hi>Quando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidem publicus gladius, non minus quam luſtralis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua quae in templorum veſtibulis collocatur, civitatis eſt piaculum. Seeing that the publick Sword no leſſe purgeth a City, then Holy Water doth, that is placed in the entry of our Churches.</hi> And thus it is kept in Churches to this day.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Teſtimony we have, is, in the more
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107258:89"/> ancient <hi>Epiphanius, Tom. 2. lib. 1. contra haereſes, haereſi</hi> 30. with me <hi>pag.</hi> 61. in the <hi>Baſil</hi> print; where the Saint tells us; that, <hi>Joſephus</hi> the Jew (ſeeing fire, contrary to its own nature, made unactive by Enchantment, and hindred from burning by Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft) called for water (a world of <hi>Jews</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) made the ſigne of the Croſs upon it, put his finger into the Veſſel of the bleſſed Water, ſaying, in the Name of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom my Fathers crucified, <hi>Fiat virtus in hac aquâ ad reprobationem omnis incantationis &amp; Magiae quam hi fecerunt. Let there be vertue in this water, for the diſolving the charms done by theſe men.</hi> Then, ſaith <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> he took ſome of the water in his hand, ſprinkled the ſeveral enchanted Furnaces with it. <hi>Et diſsoluta ſunt incantamenta, the Witchcraft ceaſed, the fire burned, the people who ſaw the wonder, cryed aloud, one God there is, who helps the Chriſtians, and ſo departed.</hi> Add hereunto, if you pleaſe, a like Miracle done by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> upon a poſſeſſed man, and with Holy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> relates it in the precedent <hi>pag. 60. Joſeph,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>having ſhut the doors, took water into his hands, bleſſed it with the ſigne of the Croſs, beſprinkled the raging man with it, commanded the Devil in the Name of Jeſus to be gone, and the poſſeſſed party was cured.</hi> This Miracle ſaith <hi>Epiphanius</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> knew, and great talk there was of it; ſome ſaid, <hi>Joſephus</hi> had opened the <hi>Gazophilacium,</hi> and finding there the <hi>Name of God writ,</hi> did the wonder by force of this Name. <hi>It was true he did the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, but not as the Jews imagined.</hi> Thus <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt place, Ile give you <hi>Theodorets</hi> Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107258:89"/> 
               <hi>lib. 5. Eccleſiaſt. hiſtor. cap.</hi> 21. in the <hi>Colen</hi> print anno 1577. <hi>pag.</hi> 312. where he tells you alſo, <hi>how the Devil hindred fire from burning, though wood, of its own nature combustible, was applied to it.</hi> The Charm (to be brief) was told the Paſtor, who forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ran to the Church, and commanded a little veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of water to be given him; this he put under the holy Altar, falling proſtrat on the ground, earneſtly begged of <hi>Almighty God not longer to ſuffer this Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. prayer ended, he made the ſigne of the Croſs upon the water, gave it to <hi>Equiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> a Deacon, commanding him withall ſpeed, to ſprinkle the enchanted fire with it, which done, ſaith <hi>Theodoret, daemon aufugit, the Devil ran away, the water burned like Oyl, and the fire conſumed the wood in a moment.</hi> If any deſire more for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of water, let him read <hi>Tertull. lib. de baptismo cap. 4. S. Ambroſ. lib. 2. de Sacram. cap. 5. and S. Auſtin Tract. 118. in Joannem.</hi> For the bleſſing of Oyl, and the <hi>Paſchal</hi> Candle, ſee <hi>Bellarmin</hi> above cited.</p>
            <p>Let us now return to our Doctor and make my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion good, <hi>viz.</hi> That he hath not ſo much as a ſyllable of either Scripture, Council, or Father, againſt the bleſſing of Water. He cites pag. 143. S. <hi>Cyril of Jeruſalem Catech.</hi> 4. Saying, <hi>that in the Holy and Divine Myſteries of our Faith, neceſſary it is to do nothing by chance or of our own heads, nor without Scripture;</hi> From whence our Doctor muſt argue thus (if he proves any thing) but to bleſs water is one of the <hi>Divine Myſteries of Faith, and done by chance or of our own heads, without holy Scripture:</hi> Therefore 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable, and an Invention of man only. To this
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107258:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> diſcourſe, I anſwer. That it is neither one of the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Faith,</hi> which S. <hi>Cyril</hi> handles in the place now cited; (for he ſpeaks there only of the equality of the Holy Ghoſt with Father and Son) neither is it <hi>done by chance or of our own heads</hi> (witneſs the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers already cited) nor <hi>without Authority of Holy Scripture, (Sanctificatur autem per verbum Dei &amp; ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>) nor finally is it againſt S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> who poſſitively to the Doctors confuſion, ſaith that water may be bleſſed, but two leaves only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own quotation; <hi>Catech.</hi> 3. with me <hi>pag. 401. (Bibliot Patrum. Colen. print, Tom.</hi> 4.) his words are. <hi>Nam ut illa quae in Aris offeruntur, cum natura ſint pura, invocatione daemonum impura efficiuntur: Sic contra, aqua ſimplex per Spiritus Sancti, Chriſti, &amp; Patris invocationem accepta virtute, ſanctitatem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequitur. As thoſe things which are offered on Altars,</hi> (he means to Idols) <hi>when pure in their own nature, are made impure by the invocation of Devils: So on the contrary, ſimple Water is made holy, gets a ſanctity by invocating the Holy Ghoſt, Chriſt our Lord, and his Eternal Father.</hi> Had the Doctor ſeen this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> he would never have troubled his Reader with the other Quotation, more remote from the purpoſe, then <hi>York</hi> is diſtant from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, our Doctor excepts againſt S. <hi>Gregories</hi> Dialogues, and unworthily ſtiles them <hi>Romantick ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, pag.</hi> 143. I anſwer; Had a frantick brain brought forth ſuch an expreſſion, none would have wondered; but that a grave Divine ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ights theſe books, highly reverenced, both by the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church, cannot be tollerated. In a word, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſhall never be able with any ſhadow of proof,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107258:90"/> to infringe their authority. What therefore that Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Saint ſaith of Bleſſed <hi>Fortunatus curing a lame man,</hi> &amp;c. is as certainly true, as that the Doctor err's in diſcrediting thoſe Dialogues.</p>
            <p>Next the good man is upon us with a jeer: <hi>They throw</hi> (ſaith he pag. 143.) <hi>this Water on ſick Cows horns, on Childrens cradles,</hi> &amp;c. Anſw. And did not the Chriſtian <hi>Italicus</hi> take water alſo from bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Hilario,</hi> and caſt it on his Enchanted ſtable, on his bewitched Horſes, on his Chariot, on the place or Barriers from whence he uſed to run? Did not the Charm or Witchery ceaſe upon this ſprinkling of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? In ſo much that all cried out. <hi>Marnas victus a Chriſto eſt. Chriſt hath conquered Marnas.</hi> Moſt true it is; no leſſe a Doctor then S. <hi>Hierom</hi> relates the ſtory, <hi>in vita Hilarionis</hi> (Paris print) <hi>pag.</hi> 323.

            <argument>
               <p>Of the Doctors dark Divinity. Of his want of Charity towards his Anceſtors, and all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Doctor ends this 11. <hi>Section, pag.</hi> 144. with a piece of ſcarce intelligible Divinity. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Sacraments</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they are taught to rely with ſo little of Moral, and vertuous Diſpoſitions, that the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:107258:91"/> Efficacy of the one is made to leſſen the neceſſity of the other.</hi> I anſwer, That every Sacrament (except Infant Baptiſm) requires a vertuous diſpoſition: Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is of no Efficacy without Contrition, or at leaſt Attrition: The other Sacraments ſtyled <hi>Vivorum,</hi> require <hi>per ſe,</hi> Supernatural inherent Grace, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their worthy receiving. How therefore <hi>the Efficacy of one, is made to leſſen the neceſſity of the other,</hi> is Divinity, too dark to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>The Doctor goes on. <hi>The Sacraments are taught to be ſo effectual by an inherent Vertue, that they are not ſo much made the Inſtruments of Vertue,</hi> as the <hi>Suppletory.</hi> Anſw. Still we are in a cloud. To get out on't, our Doctor muſt <hi>unriddle</hi> this word <hi>Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</hi> We ſay thus, and ſpeak plain Language. God, in the operation of Sacraments, is the prime effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of Grace; Chriſt, the Meritorious; Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Inſtrumental. Now, whether they work by an intrinſecal Vertue imprinted (as it were) on them, or are otherwiſe effectual, concerns nothing Catholick Religion. Supernatural inherent Grace we receive by them, when a ſoul is fitly diſpoſed: This is our Doctrine. Yet we have more obſcure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity; For he tells us, we teach, that Sacraments are not ſo much <hi>to increaſe Grace, as to make amends for the want of Grace.</hi> God only knows what he means by <hi>this making amends for the want of Grace:</hi> I do not. <hi>Qui poteſt capere capiat:</hi> We ſay (<hi>without this making amends</hi>) that Grace is effectually given in every Sacrament to that ſoul, that comes worthily diſpoſed.</p>
            <p>The Doctor in his 12. Section, page 144. talks of Idolatry, but not underſtanding what Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is, nor our Divines Tenets concerning the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107258:91"/> he ſpeaks of, fights againſt ſhadows: I'll only leave him to Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> (a great Divine of his own) to learn of him what Idolatry is, and how far the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be charg'd with it; and what the conſequences of ſuch a charge will be. Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> in his <hi>juſt Weights and Meaſures,</hi> chap. 1. diſcourſeth it at large: He ſays pag. 2. <hi>If the Pope be Antichrist, and the Papiſts Idolaters, we need not ſeek farther for the reaſon of the diſtance, we are to own the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for our own act, and glory in it.</hi> He ſays a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, pag. 7. <hi>If it be true,</hi> viz. That the Papiſts be guilty of Idolatry; <hi>we cannot without renouncing our Chriſtianity, hold communion with thoſe whom we charge with it.</hi> So that if this Section of our Doctor which charges us with Idolatry, be true: Mr. <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike</hi> tells him there is no <hi>need of ſeeking farther for the reaſon of the distance; This muſt be it,</hi> viz. <hi>That they could not hold communion with Idolaters without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing their Chriſtianity,</hi> and therefore they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>which ſeparation they own for their own act and glory in it:</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> ſayes, that if this be the beſt reaſon they can give for their ſeparation, they muſt acknowledge themſelves to be the Schiſmaticks: His own words are, Cap. 1. pag. 7. line 14. <hi>For in plain Termes we make our ſelves Schiſmaticks, by grounding our Reformation upon this pretence;</hi> and again in the ſame page line 29. <hi>So that,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>ſhould this Church declare, that the charge which we call Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is grounded upon this Suppoſition, I muſt then acknowledge that we are the Schiſmaticks.</hi> Now that <hi>this Pretence,</hi> and <hi>this Suppoſition,</hi> are the ſame which our Doctor in his Section pretends and ſuppoſes us to be guilty of, <hi>viz. Idolatry,</hi> is evident by the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107258:92"/> whole Chapter now quoted; and by the Contents of it printed before the Chapter, which end thus; <hi>They that ſeparate from the Church of Rome as Idolaters, are thereby Schiſmaticks before God:</hi> How the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor will anſwer this to his own brother, I neither know, nor care; nor can I ſee how he can poſſibly avoid the Imputation of Schiſm in Mr. <hi>Thorndik</hi>'s judgment: for he believes, or elſe he cheats his <hi>Charge,</hi> that we are Idolaters; if he does, he muſt in Mr. <hi>Thorndikes</hi> Opinion, and in all reaſon make that the ground of his Separation; And if he does do ſo, he is <hi>a Schiſmatick before God,</hi> ſayes Mr. <hi>Thorndike.</hi> This may ſerve for anſwer to his charge in general; His particular Inſtances in what we are Idolaters, are; <hi>Worſhipping of Images,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>is a direct breach of the Second Commandment, an act of Idolatry, as much as the Heathens themſelves were guilty of,</hi> &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> ſhall anſwer for us again in the Book before cited, Cap. 19. in the Contents whereof, you may read this Propoſition. <hi>Reverencing of Images in Churches is not Idolatry;</hi> In this Chapter, page 126. towards the bottome he has theſe words; <hi>Whether or no having Images in Churches be a breach of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment, can be no more queſtion, then whether or no to have any Images be a breach of it; for it muſt forbid Images in Churches, becauſe it forbids all Images:</hi> &amp;c. This and what follows in that chap. clears the having of Images in Churches, from being a breach of the Second Commandment; Now to clear the Reverencing or Worſhipping of them from being Idolatry, read the ſame Chapter on, and page 127. line 31. you ſhall find theſe words; <hi>But to the Images of Saints there can be no Idolatry, ſo long as
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107258:92"/> men take them ſor Saints; That is Gods creatures. Much leſs to the Images of our Lord; For it is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Lord, and not of his Image.</hi> And again, <hi>line the laſt</hi> of this page, and page 128. <hi>Nay the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil it ſelf</hi> (meaning the 2. of Nice) <hi>though it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the Image it ſelf is honoured, by the honour given to that which it ſignifieth, before the Image; yet it diſtinguiſheth this honour from the honour of our Lord: and therefore teacheth not Idolatry, by teaching to honour Images; though it acknowledge that the Image it ſelf is honoured, when it need not.</hi> This is quite contrary to our Doctors Divinity; <hi>The pious Children of the Church of England,</hi> may believe which they pleaſe of theſe two great Divines; the one is a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but the other ſeems the more wary man; For he makes a cautious propoſal in the 1 Chap. of his Book quoted before, page 2. line 14. <hi>It were good,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>that we did underſtand one another.</hi> And line 30. <hi>Yet it is neceſſary to provide that we contradict not our ſelves.</hi> But our Doctor never caring whom he underſtands, or who underſtands him, thinks it not neceſſary to provide that they contradict not one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, But raſhly ſayes what comes next, right or wrong. What he hath more, pag. 145, 146, 147. relate chiefly, <hi>ad modum colendi,</hi> or to the way of Worſhip; which toucheth nothing on Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or the due reverence given to Images. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines I know, diſpute this point largely, their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Opinions make no Article of Faith. Let us agree that Images are to be worſhipped in the Senſe of thoſe Fathers we cited above, and in Mr. <hi>Thorndikes</hi> Senſe; And afterward, if the Doctor pleaſe, we'll diſcuſs the Theological Difficulty, how they are to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:107258:93"/> To what our Doctor has page 148. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Idolatry of worſhipping <hi>Conſecrated Bread and Wine,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> ſhall once more anſwer for us, who by good luck has the very Inſtance of <hi>the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans worſhipping the Sun,</hi> which our Doctor ſayes is all one with our worſhipping <hi>the Conſecrated Bread and Wine.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> I dare ſay will not believe him, until he anſwers the beginning of his 19. Chap. quoted before, page 125. the Contents of which at the very beginning have this Propoſition: <hi>The worſhip of the Hoſt in the Papacy is not Idolatry:</hi> If our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor will undertake to ſatisfie Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> that he is miſtaken in what he here profeſſes to teach, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume he will oblige him highly; For he asks, pag. 5. line 22. of his <hi>Weights and Meaſures: Who will take upon him to ſhew us, that the worſhip of the Hoſt in the Papacy is Idolatry?</hi> When theſe two great Doctors are agreed which of them teaches the trueſt Divinity concerning this Point, this Section may, and it may not too, require a farther Anſwer. Till then we'll leave them to diſpute it: 'Tis pitty they ſhould be parted: <hi>Cadmus</hi> his Brood that came into the world an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and extraordinary way, are a proper Embleme of all Hereticks; Their births are monſtrous, and their ends as odd. Angry men that they are, they cannot agree, but without any other help will alwayes (if let alone) deſtroy one another.</p>

He takes on, to tell thoſe under his Charge, how matters ſtand in point of Religion, and ſaith; that <hi>we Catholicks dangerouſly err, yes, and injure Faith, ſpoil Hope, ſin againſt Charity: In a word we are men, that bring Ruin to all Religion.</hi> Faith we injure, <hi>by creating new Articles;</hi> To this
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107258:93"/> we have anſwered in the firſt Chapter, that not one new Article is created by us; though the Church, as occaſion is, may more clearly explicate ſome old ones, and hath ever done ſo. <hi>We ſpoil,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>our Hope, by placing it on Creatures. Anſw.</hi> Hope, good Doctor, is a Theological Vertue, and hath God, as he is our final good, for its <hi>formal Object.</hi> The <hi>finis qui</hi> is no Creature; the poſſeſſion of this infinit good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by a clear Viſion, is; Both theſe, which will make us happy in Heaven, we hope for, and I think, without offence. Which way, the Doctors Hope tends I know not. <hi>We ſin,</hi> ſaith he again, <hi>againſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by damning all that are not of our Opinion. Anſw.</hi> Firſt the Doctor ſins moſt grievouſly againſt Charity by damning all his Anceſtours, (his great great Grand-Father, and ſo upward for a thouſand years) why? they were all old Papiſts, and as he tells us, had <hi>naughty Faith, ſpoiled Hope, great want of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Salutary doctrine of Repentance torn in pieces,</hi> &amp;c. But none can be ſaved with a Faith, Hope, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Repentance ſpoyled, and worth nothing; Therefore his Anceſtours, (with thouſand thouſands of others) are in a ſad condition, and all damned by his doctrin. I <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'tis a Calumny to ſay we damn any for differences in Opinion. Now, if the Doctor will needs tell us what Faith, and what Opinion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in every Tenet, he goes beyond his ſkill, and takes on him to teach his betters.

               <p>The Doctors wrongful Charge on Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. His weak Exceptions againſt Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity in Speech. His cauſleſs Cavils. His Faults and Mistakes.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>PAg.</hi> 152. the Doctor begins his firſt Section thus. <hi>That in the Church of Rome, it is publickly taught by their greatest Doctors, that it is lawful to lye, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the queſtion of the Magiſtrate, to conceal their name, and tell a falſe one, to elude all examinations, and to make them inſignificant, and toothleſs, cannot be doubted,</hi> &amp;c. I <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Charge, as it is laid out, is moſt injurious. Not one amongſt us ſay's, that a lye ever is, or can be lawful in any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; it is alwayes naught, and prohibited by the Law of God, and nature. None ſay, that we may elude <hi>all examinations of the Magiſtrate.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is of ſo vaſt extent (<hi>all examinations</hi>) that it looſes credit with ſober men. True it is, moſt grave Divines hold; that in certain caſes of danger, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concernments, the ambiguous uſe of words, yes, and of mental reſtriction alſo, is allowable; but ever without a lye, never without juſt cauſe and Reaſon. Impious therefore were it, to make uſe of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, in Contracts, Leagues, Promiſes, Vowes, or Oaths, yes, and moſt blameable in ordinary Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. But,</p>
            <p>If a Confeſſor be aſked by a Judge, or any body
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:107258:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> elſe whether a penitent confeſſed ſuch a Sin, (though confeſſed) doth not the light of nature tell us, the queſtion is, if poſſibly, to be eluded; or, if <hi>preſſed on,</hi> utterly denyed with a <hi>No, he did not hear it?</hi> What will the Doctor anſwer here? will he ſay, yes? He betrayes the Penitent, and Sacrilegiouſly breaks the Seal of Confeſſion. If he ſtands dumb, and ſay's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, S. <hi>Auſtin lib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uno de mendacio ad Conſent. cap. 13, poſt medium,</hi> rightly obſerves in a like caſe of danger, <hi>Tacendo eum prodimus: per noſtram vel taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnitatem homo proditur; that by ſaying nothing we do as good as diſcloſe the Secret, and tell where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed man lyes hid,</hi> and if ſo; much more doth the ſpeechleſs Confeſſor in our caſe, (though he ſhakes his head twenty times) ſpeaks out too plainly the Penitents Sin.</p>
            <p>The Doctor therefore, with his <hi>excellent uſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and we with ours, muſt of neceſſity find a way, not on the one Side to lye, (for this is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Lawful) and on the other, to keep the Seal of Confeſſion ſafe and inviolable. How ſhall we do this? I can argue; if holy <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he poſitively affirmed <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 19. that he was his Fathers firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son <hi>Eſau,</hi> (yet was not) told no lye, as many Fathers hold; wel may a Prieſt alſo, now in the caſe now propoſed, though he poſitively affirms that he heard no ſuch Sin in Confeſſion, when he heard it, ſay <hi>no:</hi> He heard it not. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid <hi>yes,</hi> that he was <hi>Iſack's</hi> firſt begotten, yet was not, (and as we now ſuppoſe) ſaid it without a lye; the Prieſt ſayes, <hi>No:</hi> he heard not ſuch a Sin (when he heard it) and this in like manner without a lye: The Parity is right e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way, if <hi>Jacob</hi> was not a lyar. Be it how you
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107258:95"/> wil, Chriſt our Lord certainly ſpake Truth, when he told his Diſciples <hi>Joan. 7. 8. non aſcendo,</hi> that he did not aſcend to the Feaſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet, when they went he, <hi>bleſſed Lord,</hi> aſcended alſo. Here is ſome ambiguity of Speech; In the vulgar tranſlation, which I follow, (though the Greek reads <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>nondum aſcendo,</hi> and the <hi>Arabick nunc non aſcendo</hi>) and becauſe uttered by our Saviour is wholy irrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible.</p>
            <p>To clear all, I aſk of our Doctor what did this <hi>non aſcendo,</hi> ſpoken by eternal Truth ſignify? He will anſwer, that though the particle, <hi>Non,</hi> uſually makes an abſolute denyal (and therefore the Apoſtles might wel think that our Lord would not go at all to the Solemnity) yet, here it was reſtrained, and only denyed his viſible, or manifeſt aſcending, as may be gathered out of the enſuing words. <hi>Non manifeſtè, ſed quaſi in occulto; He went, but not openly.</hi> If this anſwer may paſs: I argue. The words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>non aſcendo, I aſcend not</hi> when he did aſcend, were true, though they had a reſtrained ſenſe, and only denyed the publick manner of his aſcending, not known to others: <hi>Ergo,</hi> theſe words of a Prieſt, <hi>Non andivi, I heard not ſuch a Sin,</hi> when he heard it in Confeſſion, are likewiſe true, though they have a reſtrained ſenſe and only deny the publick manner of his hearing it (in that <hi>forum</hi>) not known to others. A Diſparity here good Doctor: perhaps, He will anſwer, that the Judge or Tyrant poſitively demands whether the Prieſt heard that Sin in Confeſſion; and his ſaying, <hi>No</hi> to it, is a flat lye. By the way, had the Apoſtles aſked our Saviour whether he would aſcend to the Solemnity, and he had anſwered, as he
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107258:95"/> did, <hi>non aſcendo. No,</hi> would he have told a Lye? I am ſure <hi>No.</hi> Neither did he ſay an untruth, when, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. ſome aſked him of the day of judgement, &amp; he returned this anſwer; <hi>De die illo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of that day and hour none knows, not the Angels in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.</hi> Yet, moſt certain it is that the Son of God knew of that day: which Truth the Fathers aſſerted againſt the <hi>Arians</hi> endeavouring to prove, out of this very Scripture, that Chriſt was not God. He knew therefore of the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet ſaid, he did not know, both are true; Let the Doctor unfold this double Senſe, and we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for our preſent purpoſe. Hence learn, that though a Tyrant poſitively aſk of a Prieſt a thouſand times whether he heard ſuch a Sin in Confeſſion, the queſtion is not of his demand, (for 'tis moſt unjuſt) but whether a Prieſt may anſwer as truly, <hi>No,</hi> I did not hear it, as Chriſt our Lord ſaid, <hi>No; I aſcend not, I know not of the day;</hi> Here is the queſtion. Moſt willingly would I have the Doctors anſwer, if he finds a flaw in the Parity.</p>
            <p>Were our Doctor better verſed in Speculation, I might here ſet down the Eſſential difference between a Ly, and mental Reſtriction. In a ly men ever ſpeak againſt their mind, for, <hi>mentiri eſt contra men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ire,</hi> that is, <hi>they judge ſo, and ſpeak contrary.</hi> In mental Reſtriction a part only of our interior Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (or as we ſpeak in School <hi>Inadaequate</hi>) is only expres'd by Exterior words, or ſignes. For example, if the Doctor preaching to his people, hath this great truth in his mind: <hi>God is not in Heaven after a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal manner,</hi> and ſhould by accident Exteriorly ſay no more but thus much only. <hi>God is not in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:107258:96"/> He doth not by that half Expreſſion thwart his Judgment, or ſpeak contrary to his thoughts, but only, ſaith not fully out what he thinks. And thus it is in mental Reſtriction, what is ſaid is true, though not fully ſpoken to the capacity of the Hearer. In the Ambiguous uſe of words, uſually called <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> there is far leſs difficulty. Hence I infer (and it is an Objection of our Doctor, <hi>pag.</hi> 153.) that if an Adultreſs aſked whether ſhe be one, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>No;</hi> ſhe ſpeaks no untruth, unleſs ſhe will, but only ſayes ſhe is none publickly proved; <hi>Or in ſome ſuch like Senſe.</hi> Next ſaith our Doctor, <hi>if a man compelled to ſwear to take ſuch a one for Wife, he may ſecretly mean,</hi> if <hi>hereafter ſhe pleaſe me; And the ſame is of one compelled by a Thief to give him twenty Crowns;</hi> I anſwer, No forced Oath extorted by compulſion, is an Oath for want of Freedom and Liberty; and conſequently not Obligatory. The caſe is plain, if one ſhould take the Doctors hand <hi>per force,</hi> and make him write thus much. All I have ſaid in my <hi>Diſſuaſive</hi> from <hi>Popery</hi> is againſt my Conſcience; Would he hold himſelf obliged to ſtand to his Writing?</p>
            <p>After this he cites <hi>Vaſquez,</hi> bragging I know not of what Doctrine, and where? In 3. <hi>Tom. 4. Queſt. 93. Art. 5. Dub.</hi> 13. Anſw. <hi>Vaſquez</hi> with me, <hi>Antwerp</hi> print, 1621. hath only 4. <hi>Articles</hi> in his 93. <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and not a ſyllable in his 13. <hi>Dubium,</hi> of any bragging. In his 12. <hi>Dub. Art.</hi> 4. he treats of our preſent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but nothing do I find there to the Doctors pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. If he hath another Edition, let him friendly tell me. <hi>Page</hi> 154. (ſaith he) <hi>Diana</hi> holds, <hi>That to ſave a mans credit, an honeſt man who is aſhamed to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:107258:96"/> beg, may ſteal what is neceſſary.</hi> I anſwer, He deals not well with <hi>Diana</hi> that ſpeaks more moderately thus. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ir honeſtus, &amp; cui pro ratione ſui ſtatus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſimum, &amp; maximum dedecus eſſet mendicare, nec poſſet alia via victum ſibi acquirere, videtur poſſe clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum neceſſaria ſurripere,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It ſeemes that a man of credit, and to whom it would be moſt heavy, and a mighty diſgrace to beg, nor can by any other means get ſuſtenance to live</hi> (theſe words the Doctor conceals) <hi>it ſeemes, I ſay, that ſuch a man may ſecretly take what is neceſſary for his ſuſtenance. Secus ſi eſset infimae ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But this holds not in caſe he be of a low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and might without a notable loſs of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour beg, or otherwiſe find neceſſaries. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Diana,</hi> far of from that high Senſe the Doctor ſets down.

               <hi>Page</hi> 155. the Doctor ſaith, <hi>That it is affirmed, and was practis'd by a whole Council of Biſhops at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks: And</hi> John Hus, <hi>and</hi> Hierom <hi>of</hi> Prague <hi>felt the miſchief of violation of publick Faith,</hi> &amp;c. Anſw. An old ſtory, and as falſe as old: For, firſt, the Council never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, <hi>that Faith given by Eccleſiaſtical power to an Heretick, is not to be kept.</hi> Nay, it holds it ſelf obliged to ſtand to ſuch a promiſe; Faithfully alſo complied with it in the after Councils of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Trent.</hi> Yet more; This Council holds, that a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prince or Magiſtrate after ſecurity promiſed to an Heretick, is bound to keep it, although neither the one or other can force the Church ('tis a diſtinct Tribunal) to do ſo. True it is that King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> who had given a ſafe conduct to <hi>Hus,</hi> ſeemed at firſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107258:97"/> to feel his Condemnation; but when he perceived the obſtinacy of the man, neither relenting after his own Princely Counſel, nor yeelding to the advice of others, he did not only condeſcend to puniſh <hi>Hus,</hi> but exhorted the Fathers Aſſembled at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> to proceed ſeverely againſt him: And why? <hi>John Hus</hi> violated the Laws of his ſafe conduct ſhamefully, and ran away from the Council; Yet catch'd he was, and committed to Priſon, and had his condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; His running away made him a guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on a new ſcore, and by it loſt the priviledge of his ſafe conduct. Here you have in brief the true Story. <hi>Spondanus</hi> relates it, <hi>Tom. 2.

            <p>What the Doctor hath, page 156. of the <hi>Pope</hi> diſpenſing in Oaths, when they hinder a greater good, ſeems to me a childiſh Objection: For, do not ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Princes dayly, though a man by Law deſerves death, graciouſly reprieve him, when they prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge it better to free ſuch a Delinquent then to have him die?

               <p>The Doctors ſtrange way of Arguing againſt the Exemption of Clergy-men. His unjuſt deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Emanuel Sa.</hi> His unworthy ſlaight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Seal of Confeſſion.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>PAge 160. Sect. 2. He tells <hi>us of a notorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety own'd by us in Exempting the Clergy from the Juriſdiction of Secular Princes, both in their Eſtates and perſons,</hi> &amp;c. And for this our Tenet, he cites the Canon Law (after his manner unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) <hi>Bellarm. Suarez,</hi> and others. And what, out of this good Doctor, is the meer relating of a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, a Confutation of it? If ſo, I have here ſet down yours, and therefore confuted it; A weak way of Arguing. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> brings his proofs for his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:107258:98"/> of Clergy-men: Where are yours to the contrary? <hi>Suarez, defenſ. fidei Cathol. lib. 4. cap. 15. per totum,</hi> learnedly ſhews out of Ancient Councils, the Canon and Civil Law this Exemption ratified, <hi>even in Cauſes criminal.</hi> And not one Canon, or Council, have you in your Margent (often charged with ſuperfluous Quotations) to gainſay him. page 162. you alledge that Text of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Power;</hi> And ſo ſay we alſo good Doctor, and tell you that Clergy-men have their higher Powers, and Seculars theirs; both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively owe and own obedience to their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. Here is all you prove. O, but S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, upon this Text: <hi>Etiamſi Apoſtolus ſis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you be an Apoſtle, an Evangeliſt, a Prophet, or whoſoever; you are to be ſubject to Supereminent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> I anſwer. Every word is exactly true, but the Saint mentioneth nothing of Clergy-men liable to the Judicature of a Secular Magiſtrate; but rather the contrary: For ſaith he, <hi>Neque enim de hoc aut illo Principe ſermo mihi nunc eſt, ſed de ipſa re. I ſpeak not of this or that Prince, but of Subjection it ſelf;</hi> and I ſay, that every Soul is to have it; The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to his Maſter, the Wife to her Husband, Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to their Prince. Yes, and I add, Clergy-men alſo in civil Affairs, for there is not one among us who doth not profeſs with all candor, a dutiful obedience to his Prince, to his Magiſtrate, to the Laws of the Country he lives in; If he proves criminal in theſe, the Church doth not patronize him, but, when the guilt goes high, quits him, and turns him over to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Power for puniſhment. Good civil Laws there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and Eccleſiaſtical, run ever, as it were hand in
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107258:98"/> hand together; both, like two eyes of the ſame body looke one way, haue the ſame end which is the peace and welfare of a kingdom: obedience to the one yeilds obedience to the other, an offence againſt the civil Law joyntly implyes an offence againſt the Eccleſiaſtical; when either Prince or Magiſtrate are wrongfuly dealt with, the Pope looks not on and laughes, but condoles with them, yes and holds himſelf, and his Lawes injured alſo. Can more be deſired, if men would ſet paſſion aſide, and ſuffer reaſon to ſay down right what is reaſonable?</p>
            <p>Hence you may ſolve that weak objection of our Doctor page 161. <hi>Princes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have many times felt the evil, when ſo many thouſand perſons are in their Kingdoms, and yet ſubject to a forreign power. Solve it I ſay,</hi> for the Subjection they owe is in point of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual juriſdiction only, whereunto ſecular Princes hitherto never laid claime; and with this Subjection the Civil Laws in Kingdomes ſtand ſtill in vigor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging every Soul to a dutiful Obedience. I have ſaid it now, and 'tis moſt true; that Eccleſiaſtical, and civil Laws, (rightly, as we here ſuppoſe, conſtituted) never claſh with one another. <hi>No;</hi> Peace, Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and perfect Union among all, is the final aime of both; if men devoid of paſſion, would but rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand it.</p>
            <p>The Doctors repining at the Eccleſiaſtical mens Eſtates, exempted from the juriſdiction of Secular Princes, looks (as it is) like a vain cavil; for what have theſe <hi>as Clericks,</hi> but their Tythes, (Tythes I think the Doctor will hold of Divine Right) and the ancient liberal Benevolence of pious Chriſtians to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich them? (The Doctor if a Biſhop, eates yet their
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107258:99"/> bread) and theſe bleſſed Men gave their goods ſolely to the Church: Emperours and Princes liked wel of the Charity, and approved it; therefore we need not now diſpute here, <hi>quo jure,</hi> by what right Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are exempted; it is ſufficient to ſay, that the <hi>Donors</hi> and Princes freed them; Yet, this Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on follows them, as all Divines hold, that at leaſt they are bound in Charity to give what is ſuperfluous to the poor; which Charity alſo moves them to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their Prince when neceſſity requires it. Thus they have anciently done, and yet comply with the like duty the whole world over. Such men, good Doctor are ſuppoſed vertuous; and believe it, vertue doth more then force. Needleſs therefore it is to wrong their priviledges, and wreſt from them with ſeverity what may be had in a ſweeter way. Truly I think, if the Clergy in <hi>England</hi> or Univerſities either, were forced againſt their Priviledges, and paid taxes as Secular men do every where, they would feele it a little.</p>
            <p>However if the Doctor likes it, let him on Gods name pay his <hi>quota,</hi> and liſt himſelf among Seculars, for, in real Truth he is no better, his Clerkſhip will not free him.</p>
            <p>Page 162. he cites <hi>Emanuel Sa,</hi> for this abominable aſſertion, <hi>Aphoris. verbo Clericus. The rebellion of a Clergy-man againſt his Prince is not Treaſon, becauſe he is not his Princes Subject:</hi> And ſayes, <hi>though theſe words were left out of the</hi> Paris <hi>Edition, becauſe the French men endured not the Doctrine, yet they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Editions of</hi> Antwerp, <hi>and</hi> Collen. Anſw. I have now before me the <hi>Antwerp Edition,</hi> 1599. and have read exactly every Number or Section under
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107258:99"/> that word <hi>Clericus,</hi> (53 in all) and therefore will boldly ſay it, that <hi>Sa</hi> is unworthily wronged, for he hath not through <hi>theſe 53. Numbers,</hi> a ſyllable like this Quotation of the Doctor, but rather the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>A Clergy man,</hi> ſaith he, n. 6. <hi>carrying Arms for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid by Secular Laws, may have his Armour taken from him by the Miniſters of ſecular Juſtice.</hi> Again n. 7. <hi>A Clergy man taken in a crime, may be laid hold of by a ſecular Judge, and given up to the Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> &amp;c. And ſurely, much more may he be roughly dealt with, if catch'd in the higheſt crime, or found guilty of rebellion againſt his lawful Sovereign. I therefore tell the Doctor, ſuch a Clergy man deſerves hanging: and that not ſo much as one Aphoriſm in <hi>Sa,</hi> will ſave his life.</p>
            <p>In the laſt Paragraph of this Section, page 162. and 163. our Doctor is pleaſed to ſpeak of another Iniquity (ſo he terms it) whereof our men are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And what is it? <hi>They hold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the ſeal of Confeſſion ſo highly of Divine right, and Sacred, that it cannot bee broken to ſave the lives of Princes, or the whole world.</hi> I anſwer they ſay alſo, that to ſave the lives of Popes, of Biſhops, of Prelats or the Church from ruin the ſeal of Confeſſion (made ſecret by God and nature) cannot be violated. What miſchief then have we more by this Doctrine againſt Princes and worldly Intereſt, than againſt Popes, and the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual welfare of the Church? All, God knows, are a like concerned in the danger (if any were) though the kindneſs of our Doctor is for the ſecurity of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Princes only. More flattery believe it here, then good Divinity.</p>
            <p>To treat in this place of the great ſecreſie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107258:100"/> the ſeal of Confeſſion indiſpenſably binds us, is neither my task, nor any way requiſite. Divines have amply done it to our hand. It is enough to tell you, how unworthily the Doctor fleights both Seal and Secreſie in the laſt lines of his Section, where he calls it <hi>a trifling Fancy of our own.</hi> A ſtrange word in the mouth of a Doctor, which may both juſtly work a diſtruſt in the heart of any penitent, and make confeſſion ridiculous, even among <hi>the pious Children of the Church of</hi> England.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of the Doctors injurious Calumnies. Of his unjuſt Quotations.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Doctor, pag. 164. and laſt Section tells us, <hi>That the whole order of Jeſuites is a great enemy to Monarchy, by ſubjecting the Dignity of Princes to the Pope, by making the Pope ſupreme Monarch of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and this they teach,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer. The calumny is ſo enormouſly great, that I wonder the Doctor trembled not to write as he hath done, and diſgrace himſelf with it: For, if ever men <hi>immovably</hi> ſtood for Monarchy, both in Church and Kingdomes, they <hi>are Jeſuites.</hi> To prove this Aſſertion, I need no more, but only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you to one Learned <hi>Bellarmin</hi> (and there is no Jeſuite gainſays him) <hi>lib. 1. de Romano Pontifice,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107258:100"/> cap.</hi> 2. where he ſhews both by the Authority of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Philoſophers, and Chriſtian Writers, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, ſimply conſidered, is a better Government then <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> or <hi>Democracy:</hi> Farr is he off from <hi>Calvins</hi> ſpirit, that thought it intollerable both in Eccleſiaſtical and Secular Government. O, but they deſtroy Monarchy by ſubjecting the <hi>Dignity of Princes to the Pope, and making him the ſupreme Monarch of Chriſtians.</hi> I anſwer. Had the Doctor made ſome Canoniſts (leſs conſiderable in their writings) aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Papal power, even in Politicks, he had been more moderate: But to aſcribe the Doctrine to the <hi>whole Order of Jeſuites</hi> runs beyond all bounds of Truth. Jeſuites in this particular hold with the other Catholick Doctors, and ſay that the Pope is the Supreme viſible Head of the Church in Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is in Power, and juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical: Conſequently is neither Lord, nor Monarch of the whole World, nor finally hath directly by Divine right any Temporal juriſdiction over Princes. See for this Aſſertion, <hi>Bellar. lib. 5. de potest. pont. cap.</hi> 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Whence it follows (and <hi>Jeſuites</hi> aſſert it) that Princes are the ſole ſupreme Lords, and Monarchs in their reſpective Dominions ſubject to none, if we conſider their Secular power, but to God only.</p>
            <p>Princely dignity therefore ſtands unſhaken, no Pope layes claim to that Soveraignty, or meddles with it. My God! had our Proteſtant Miniſters (as it behoov'd dutiful Children) been as careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve inviolably Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy in the Church, as Popes have ever ſhewed themſelves tender Fathers to uphold the Monarchy of Princes, the World now had not ſeen what it ſees, and deplores;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107258:101"/> I mean thoſe woful Rents and Schiſms, which theſe wantonizing Children have made in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> while the good old Father looks on with a heavy heart, and bemoans their folly. Know then for certain ('tis no diſpute) Proteſtant Miniſters are the men that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Monarchy of Spiritual juriſdiction, erected by Almighty God in the Church (this is their crying ſin, unpardonable without Repentance) whereunto Secular Princes never made claim, nor can they in Juſtice. Let then the Pope have ſtill the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Spiritual Juriſdiction over the Church ('tis his due) he ſeeks not for more, our quarrels are end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And tell me I beſeech you, are not Princes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecured in their Dignities by owning this Spiritual Power, as due to a Supreme Paſtor, who is Vigilant for their ſafety, and has no little ſway in the world; then to have their Princely Prerogatives called into queſtion, debated, yes, and judged alſo by a knot of fickle Puritans (as changeable as the Moon) who now ſtand up defendants of Regal Power, now turn ſtiff Opponents, and arm againſt it: Now they Crown their Monarch, now pull the Crown off his Head. Such doings we have ſeen, and bewailed the Injury done to Princes. Thought, we ſay, is free; Every body may think ſafely: but I'll at preſent be a little bolder and ſpeak out plainly. Had <hi>England</hi> in the laſt unfortunate Civil Wars been as it was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Catholick, or own'd as once it did, a due Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the <hi>Pope.</hi> None perhaps had ſeen ſo much as a Sword drawn againſt our Gratious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign (who now Reigns) nor his Royal Father ſo barbarouſly murthered as he was by his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. <hi>No.</hi> For if Eccleſiaſtical cenſures had not
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107258:101"/> ſtopp'd the raging fury of thoſe <hi>Regicides;</hi> one ſpark of Catholick Religion would have mollified ſuch hearts though made of <hi>Adamant;</hi> But what will ye? When both Religion is banniſhed, and Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is held contemptible: Paſſion will ſway cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Laws, make Scaffolds, draw Swords, kill Kings. and what not?</p>
            <p>In the next place our Doctor, pag. 165, and 166. enters upon this very odious ſubject of depoſing and killing Kings, and ſayes we Catholicks are Defenders of both. <hi>Mariana</hi> and <hi>Santarel</hi> are produced by him for horrid things ſpoken. Anſw. As I hate at my heart to do ſo much as mention this impious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of killing Kings, and abhor more to approve it; So, for no provocation of any, will I ſpeak a word ('tis forbid me) of their depoſing. Though were I minded to recriminate: that one Execrable and Tragical ſhedding of our late Sovereigns blood without pitty poured out in his own Pallace, in the ſight of the Sun, and open view of the World (it yet draws ſighs from many a heart) ſpeaks loud e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of a Prince more horridly depoſed and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, then ever yet came to the knowledge of Chriſtians, or any <hi>Mariana</hi> once thought of. And who were the Actors in this Abominable Tragedy? Men of a reformed Faith (and did it not in a ſudden paſſion, but deliberately, which aggravates the crime) while Catholicks, ever loyal to their Sovereign, look'd on with weeping eyes, and heavy hearts. Who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, who applauded that dayes ſinful work? Thoſe of the ſame bran, <hi>John Milton</hi> was one: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his wicked Book againſt <hi>Salmatius,</hi> whoſe only praiſe is to ſpeak Treaſon in good Latine. What
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:107258:102"/> Doctors have we found among Catholicks ſince the death of our Sovereign, that either ſide with <hi>Milton,</hi> or ſpeak a ſyllable in defenſe of thoſe <hi>Regicides?</hi> not one. All unanimouſly cry ſhame upon them, curſe, and anathematize the Fact, and ſay t'was damnable.</p>
            <p>Now after this ſo crying a Sin, to hear a Doctor harp upon the far leſſer faults of <hi>Mariana &amp; Santarel,</hi> what is it but a weak and too ſpleniſh a Recriminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? They ſaid ill. Be it ſo (if yet <hi>Mariana</hi> ſaid it) their Doctrine is therefore prohibited, and lies under cenſure) but have they either ſaid or done like theſe now mentioned? What I ſay is not to touch in the leaſt any Proteſtant loyal to his Sovereign. <hi>No;</hi> but only to tell the Doctor he did not well, to rub on old Soars in others abroad, while he hath more feſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers</hi> to look on, and Lance in ſome of his own Brethren at home; I ſay <hi>in ſome,</hi> for innumerable were Loyal, and thoſe I touch not; Charity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might well have told him, that the fault of a few is never to be caſt on the greater part, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and harmleſs.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the Loyal fidelity both of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and forreign Catholicks towards their Prince and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate (could I licenſe this ſhort Treatiſe to grow to a greater bulk) much might be ſaid, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is already enough publiſhed by that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Author of the Proteſtants Apology (the Book is had in <hi>England</hi>) printed anno 1608. where, <hi>Tract. 3. Sect.</hi> 3, 4, &amp; 5. pag. 658, 663, 667. You ſhall find the Loyalty of Catholicks (if Reaſon, Authority and Confeſſion of Adverſaries may have place) ſtrongly aſſerted. Beſide other undenyable proofs; he obſervs page 662. that when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entred
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:107258:102"/> the Throne Royal, all received her with moſt dutiful ſubmiſſion. The then Catholick Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop and chancellor of England, in a publick oration perſwaded the people to acknowledg her Maieſty for their lawful Queen and Sovereign: And a like Loyal reſpect ſhe had from other Catholick Lords and Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But was it ſo when queen Mary, that reigned before her, came to the Crown? No, ſaith my Author, open rebellion in open field (<hi>Stow</hi> recounts it in his <hi>Annals,</hi> the pages are there exactly cited) was her publick welcome (and there was more of it in her 5. Years, then in 25. of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) and private turbulent Spirits, (witneſs that Dagger thrown at one Preachers head at <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſs; and a Gun ſhot off at another) gave her no better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. Parallel here the Receptions of theſe two Sovereigns, and ſay candidly, who were then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſubmiſſive, who, untowardly rebellious.

See for this Aſſertion the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Apology, <hi>Tract 3. Sect. 2. pag.</hi> 649. but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Preface to the Reader, from <hi>pag.</hi> the 10. to the end. From this moſt Learned and Laborious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I will borrow ſome few of thoſe many Inſtances he hath in that Preface to anſwer a pithleſs cavil of our Doctor, <hi>p.</hi> 171. Where,</p>
            <pb n="202" facs="tcp:107258:103"/>
            <p>He dares not deny, but that ſome <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and warm ſpirited <hi>Puritans,</hi> may have been reprehenſible (<hi>atleaſt Catholicks recriminate them in this point</hi>) yet he gravely adds; <hi>That indeed they borrowed theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines from Rome, uſing their Arguments, making uſe of their Expreſſions, and purſuing their Principles.</hi> Anſw. And is it poſſible, can a Doctor talk thus? Can ſober men give credit to his Obloquy? Pray you tell me, when the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Huſſites</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the <hi>Wicleffians</hi> in <hi>England</hi> (ſome make theſe men Proteſtants) ranted and vapour'd as they did, contemned Magiſtrates, raiſed up Rebellion, and acted ſo Tragically againſt their lawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, &amp;c. Did <hi>Rome</hi> learn them their Leſſon? did <hi>Rome</hi> teach them the Dotage, to contemn <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Diſcipline? When that <hi>Hector</hi>-rampant <hi>Ziſca</hi> (the <hi>Huſſites</hi> General) after the Ravage and Violences done on his own Native Country, falling ſick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his ſkin to be pull'd of his dead Carkaſs, and a Drum to be made of it, which the <hi>Huſſites</hi> ſhould uſe afterward in Battel: Had he think yea <hi>Breve</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> to do this more then <hi>Scithian</hi> cruelty on himſelf? When <hi>Martin Luther</hi> Dogmatically taught, <hi>That amongſt Chriſtians no man ought to be Magiſtrate, none Superior, and being told that he troubled the World with his new Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. He returned this accurſed Anſwer. <hi>Quereris quod per Evangelium noſtrum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou complaineſt that by our Goſpel the World is become tumultuous. I anſwer: God be thanked for it, I would have it ſo, wo to me</hi> (He might have added and to my Kate alſo) <hi>if things were not as they are, all in tumults.</hi> When I ſay ſuch Malice againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> boyled hot at his heart, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:107258:103"/> the filthy froth of his rage ran thus out of his mouth, did <hi>Rome</hi> add fuel to that flame, or make that Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of iniquity to boyl as it did? <hi>Apage Nugas.</hi> 'Tis triffling to ſay ſo. Again, when ſneveling <hi>Calvin</hi> (to ſay nothing of <hi>Zuinglius</hi>) ſeditiouſly vented. <hi>That Earthly Princes bereaved themſelves of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if they were against God: and that they are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be reckon'd amongſt the number of men; that we may ſpit in their faces</hi> (ſo this holy faced man ſpeaks) <hi>rather then obey them.</hi> Did <hi>Rome</hi> either inſtil ſuch Poyſon into his Breaſt, or lay that Venom on his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious Tongue? No God knows: both <hi>Rome</hi> and the Rhemiſh Doctors aſſert; <hi>that Chriſtians are obliged in Conſcience to obey even Heathen Emperors. And worthy Doctor</hi> Kelliſon, doubts not to ſay: <hi>That Faith is not neceſſary to Juriſdiction Temporal, neither is Authority loſt by the loſs of Faith.</hi> See theſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities quoted in the Proteſtants Apology, <hi>Tract. 3.

For I know it is written, that who reſiſteth Power reſiſteth the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and purchaſeth to himſelf damnation.</hi> Here is our Catholick profeſſion: <hi>Rome</hi> both thinks and ſpeaks with us; to take off the Doctors injurious charge laid on us in this Paragraph, I have ſaid thus much, never intending to caſt the leaſt aſpertion on any Proteſtant that is Loyal to his Sovereign.</p>
            <p>Next the Doctor quotes <hi>Suarez lib. 6. defenſ. fidei cap. 6. Sect. 24. (Sa</hi> is alſo cited and <hi>Scribanius,</hi> but without their places) for this aſſertion. <hi>An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicat King may with impunity be depos'd or killed by any one.</hi> Anſw. He either never read <hi>Suarez,</hi> or is unpardonably guilty of falſity.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:107258:104"/> alone, and nudely conſidered, impowres no body to kill the excommunicated party, nor to deprive him of his Dominions, but only debarrs him from communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with others. Rex ergo excommunicatus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A King therefore excommunicated only, if the Sentence ſay no more, cannot be depoſed, and killed by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or any,</hi> ſaith <hi>Suarez.</hi> 'Tis true he adds a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which, becauſe I think the Doctor well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not, I omit to ſay more of. A ſufficient vindication it is to tel you, that the propoſition here ſet down for <hi>Suarez</hi> his doctrin is none of his, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly falſe in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Page 167. after <hi>Suarez</hi> he hath a bout with <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> for a ſtrange propoſition, and thus it is <hi>lib. 4. de Rom.

Si autem Papa erraret</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If the Pope ſhould err by commanding vice, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding vertue, the Church were obliged to believe, that vices were good, and vertues evil, unleſs it would ſin against Conſcience.</hi> They are the very words of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> ſaith our Doctor. <hi>Anſw.</hi> they are ſo, but moſt unworthily weigh'd out of their circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and as they ſtand here alone ſeem to aſſert I know not what miſchief or error; whereas moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in the context of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> they have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Senſe, and prove that neither Pope nor Church can err. Obſerve I beſeech you, <hi>Bell. in his §. above, Ac ut rem totam,</hi> ſaith, <hi>it cannot be that the Pope err by commanding any Vice; as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury: or, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding any vertue,</hi> as <hi>reſtitution: &amp;c.</hi> This he proves firſt § <hi>quod autem, becauſe the Church would not be called holy, if he did ſo.</hi> 2. Becauſe, <hi>if the Pope taught ſueh a doctrine, the Church would err in Faith; for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith aſſures us, that vertue is good, and Vice
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107258:105"/> is evil.</hi> Now ſaith <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> (and here are the <hi>miſconſtrued words</hi> of our Doctor) <hi>if the Pope ſhould err, by commanding Vice, and forbidding Vertue, the whole Church would be bound to believe amiſs;</hi> which you ſee does not aſſert any error in Pope or Church, but plainly excludes both, and renders this Senſe. Moſt impious it is, to think that the whole Church is bound to believe that Vice is good, and Vertue naught: therefore, impious it is to judge that the Pope can err in commanding Vice, and forbidding Vertue: As if one ſhould ſay, wicked it is, to hold that the whole body of Chriſtianity believes amiſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is impious to hold that God commands us to believe ſo. In a word; the whole diſcourſe of <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> is grounded on this Principle, that the <hi>Pope, as Pope,</hi> cannot err; and by deſtroying it (ſaith this learned Authour) you may ſee what follows, an Univerſal Error or Misbelief in the Catholick Church. This is moſt exactly <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Senſe: and for my Aſſertion, I appeal to the judgment of every Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Reader: And therefore cannot but pitty the Doctor, and moſt of our Proteſtants too, who poor men (utterly deſtitute of all Antiquity) will rather play at <hi>ſmall Game</hi> then <hi>ſit out:</hi> piddle they muſt, and glean in our Authours: faults, if fancied, muſt be found: words wreſted, Sence turn'd out of Sentences: The leaſt hint ſerves them to miſconſtrue all. Thus they proceed, though it coſt them dear, an Eternal loſs of their credit.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Of our Doctors failing in History. Of his blaming Popes that are blameleſs. A word of his Concluſion.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>OUr Doctor having now wronged <hi>Suarez,</hi> and <hi>Bellarm.</hi> ſets fiercely againſt <hi>Popes,</hi> and ſpeaks of their wickedneſs alſo; but handles the matter ſo confuſedly that no Reader can be the wiſer for any Story he tells us. He neither names Pope, nor quotes Authour for what he ſayes, but begins thus, pag. 167. <hi>All the World knows what the</hi> Pope <hi>did to King</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick <hi>of</hi> France: <hi>He depos'd him and put</hi> Pipin <hi>in his place.</hi> Anſw. I think the Doctor knows not this Story very well (therefore all the World 'tis like knows it not) which he diſpatches in a word, and runs ſlightly over. However you have it largely in <hi>Scipion Dupleix</hi> the Kings Counſeller, <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <hi>Memoires des Gaules, Paris print, 1627. pag. chiefly, 282. Les Francois ont recourſ au Pape Zacharie,</hi> &amp;c. where you ſhall read that the French men themſelves <hi>tous les Seigneurs all the Nobles,</hi> ſaith <hi>Dupleix, page 283. finding the great inabilities of</hi> Childerick, <hi>and unfitneſs to govern a Kingdome, ſtood for</hi> Pipin, <hi>petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the Pope upon weighty Reaſons to diſpenſe in their Oath of Fidelity made to</hi> Childerick; <hi>the Pope condeſcended,</hi> but ſaith this Author page 286. <hi>ſi au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuns,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if any of the ancient Chronicles have attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this great change to the Pope, they have writ both ignorantly and barbarouſly:</hi> In a word, the French
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107258:106"/> men did it themſelves; nor had they, (as <hi>Dupleix</hi> affirms in his title page 285.) any neceſſity at all to have had any recourſe to the Pope for depoſing <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick.</hi> To take away all cavil, I rather cite a French Authour, both Counſeller, and Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to the King of <hi>France,</hi> then any other. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the differences between <hi>Pope Boniface the</hi> 8. and <hi>Philip le Bell,</hi> you have a whole Book ſet forth by a French Authour not named, nor too great a friend to the <hi>Pope:</hi> The Title is. <hi>Hiſtoire du diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend d'entre le Pape,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Paris</hi> print, 1655. Where you ſhall find no little Animoſity in <hi>Philip,</hi> and a paternal Condeſcendency in <hi>Boniface,</hi> euer ready to comply with that Prince. Tedious it would be to tell the whole Story.</p>
            <p>The Doctor goes on. <hi>They were Popes of Rome that armed the Son againſt the Father the Emperour</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>; <hi>the Son fought againſt him, took him priſoner,</hi> &amp;c. Anſw. An infinite patience is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to hear a Doctor talk as this does. Moſt juſtly may we ſay here, <hi>the whole World knows,</hi> what a man <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. was, <hi>an Heretick, a Sacrilegious wretch, one given to Sodomy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Stephanus Alberſtatenſis</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Walram Biſhop, which Dodechinus</hi> relates in his Appendix to <hi>Marianus Scotus, anno</hi> 1090. page 460. <hi>A light headed Fellow, and raſh, of no Counſel, mighty bold, and of a diſſolute life, who ſet the Biſhopricks of</hi> Germany <hi>to ſale,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith, Even good <hi>John Calvin, lib. 4. inſtit. cap.</hi> 11. §. 13. his own pious and worthy Kinſman; <hi>Otho Friſingenſis,</hi> ſaith <hi>lib. 7. cap. 11. That he was promoted, potenter magis, quam juſte, more by Power then Juſtice, or honeſt Dealing.</hi> Theſe truths ſuppoſed which no
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:107258:106"/> hiſtorian queſtions, (excpt one <hi>lying Benno,</hi> ſo <hi>Gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi> cals him <hi>tomo 2. in his Apol. for Greg. the 7. p.</hi> 218. what is to be done with ſuch a Prince? muſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel it out? run on in his lewdneſs? ruin the Church? deſtroy Kingdomes, injure Princes without reſtraint, or Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure? Let the Doctor ſay can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly, whether ſuch an ungratious Son of the Church may be tolerated, without being curb'd at all, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate, or rather to tear out the very bowels of that Mother that begot him, and made him Chriſtian? Nothing can be anſwer'd with probability, but that the Church has power to check ſuch inſolences. And,</p>
            <p>To ſilence the Doctors groundleſs complaint, hear in a word how it was done: <hi>Marianus Scotus</hi> is my Authour, <hi>lib. 3. Cron. Aetat. 6. ad annum, 1075. page: chiefly 454. Franck fort print,</hi> 1613. Where he firſt relates the Kings wickedneſs, then adds. <hi>Haec &amp; his ſimilia nefanda &amp; inandita Henrici Regis fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitia, videntes &amp; audientes fieri Catholici viri,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Catholick men, conſtituted at that time in the Church, ſeeing, and hearing of ſuch enormous Crimes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by King</hi> Henry, <hi>were carried on with zeal (like another</hi> Helias) <hi>for the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and therefore ſent Meſſengers to Pope</hi> Alexander, <hi>and as well by Letter, as word of mouth with ſighs and grief, made their grievances known,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Alexander</hi> dying, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. ſucceeded him. <hi>Iſte querimonijs, &amp; clamoribus Catholicorum juſtis adverſum Henricum, &amp; ſcelerum immanitatem auditis, zelo Dei accenſus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This Pope</hi> Gregory <hi>having heard the juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, the loud clamours of Catholicks againſt</hi> Henry <hi>and his outragious proceedings, moved with zeal of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:107258:107"/> God, declared him Excommunicated, chiefly for his Simony.</hi> Thus <hi>Marianus.</hi> Where you ſee that the Pope depos'd him not, but only declared him an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate perſon; and this at the importunate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and juſt Complaints of the <hi>German</hi> Princes: He that deſires to know more of this unfortunate King, let him read <hi>Baronius</hi> chiefly, <hi>ad annum, 1080. Tom.</hi> 11. where, <hi>pag. 532. Antwerp</hi> print, 1608. <hi>lit. D.</hi> He ſhall find how juſtly that heavy Cenſure of the Church fell upon him; how he was vilified by his own Children; forced by them out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and died in miſery. <hi>It was God,</hi> ſaith Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, <hi>that ſhew'd his Judgment on him; (though late) dum filios in patrem ſtatuit eſſe carnifices acerbiſſimos ſuae ſententiae executores, while he made his own Sons to be Torturers of their Father, and revengers of his juſt Sentence.</hi> Our Doctor therefore both cavils, and calumniats while he talks of <hi>Popes arming Sons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Father,</hi> &amp;c. And to take <hi>off</hi> more cavils, moſt willingly would I have him to name that Pope (and quote his Authour) that made <hi>Charles the 5. and Francis the firſt of France take Arms againſt other Princes.</hi> I love not, good Doctor, this running on in darkneſs: Produce your Authours. An anſwer is ready. Yet,</p>
            <p>Omit I cannot to ſay a word, of <hi>Francis Dandulus whom</hi> (ſaith our Doctor) <hi>being Duke of Venice, the Pope bound with Chains, and fed him as Dogs arc fed with bones, and ſcraps under his Table.</hi> Anſw. It would make one ſick to hear this tattle. Where read we, for Gods fake, that the Pope chain'd <hi>Dandulus?</hi> where, that he fed him like a Dog, or caſt him bones and ſcraps? where, that <hi>Dandulus</hi> was then Duke of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:107258:107"/> 
               <hi>Venice?</hi> All is coyn'd by the Doctor, who, as he tels his tale, makes the Pope a Beaſt: Whereas, God knows, the ſtory is quite contrary, and Briefly thus.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> had by their wrongs and violences highly offended Pope Clement the 5. and for a long time ſlighted his cenſures. At laſt (more wiſe) they ſought for pardon, as <hi>Spondanus</hi> recounts <hi>ad an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num 1310. num. 5. Tom. 1. pag.</hi> 518.</p>
            <p>This good man therefore, <hi>Francis Dandulus</hi> (no Duke then, but of the Doctors making) yet, of note and nobility among the States, preſs'd them with might and main to a due Submiſſion. And to gain pardon for their inſolencies, on his own free accord, (compelled by no Pope) he ſacrificed his honor, and did as ſtrange an Act of humility as perhaps is read in Story. <hi>Sabellicus,</hi> an exact writer of the <hi>Venetian</hi> affaires relates it (<hi>Tom. 2. Baſil print. Ennead. 9. lib. 7 pag.</hi> 791. in this manner. <hi>Eranciſcus Dandulus illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri exemplo privatae pietatis in patriam, publicae in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionem, catenâ ferreâ collo injectá, ad ejus menſam tam diu proſtratus jacuit</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Francis Dandulus by a rare example of ſpecial piety towards his Country, and publick for Religion, having caſt an iron Chain about his neck, went to the Popes table, and lay there proſtrat ſo long. Donec, expugnatâ Clementis irâ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Til, by force of his vertue, he vanquiſhed</hi> Clements <hi>anger, and cancelled the black ignominious note, which lay on his Country; whence it is,</hi> ſaith <hi>Sabellicus, that he was afterward called by the name of Dog; yet,</hi> (witneſs <hi>Spondanus</hi>) was welcom'd home with the applauſe of all, and ſome years after made Prince in <hi>John</hi>'s place that dyed. Here is a difference between the Doctors ſtory and mine; mine hath nothing of ſcraps
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:107258:108"/> or bones, or of the Popes feeding, and chaining <hi>Dandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> &amp;c. Pray you tell me, if our Miniſters in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> wearied out with their Schiſm, and Hereſie (higher crimes then the <hi>Venetians</hi> were guilty of) became, at laſt, ſeriouſly penitent for both, and to ſatisfie how earneſtly they ſeek for pardon, ſhould ſend up the Doctor to follow the cauſe, and obtain pardon at <hi>Rome:</hi> Yet more, if the Doctor like a good Patriot, to effect what he comes for, ſhould on his own free choice, humble himſelf as <hi>Dandulus</hi> did; throw a Chain about his neck, fall proſtrate at the <hi>Popes</hi> Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Will any man ſay in juſtice and conſcience that the <hi>Pope</hi> chained him, or fed him like a Dog with ſcraps? Here is the right ſtory, if good Authours wrong us not.</p>
            <p>What he next hints at, is indeed a known thing of our King <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. Briefly. This Prince both ſinned and repented; his ſin in ſhedding of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Martyrs blood, S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was great; And, his ſorrowful repentance for the fact, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and praiſe worthy. As all deplore the ſin, ſo they make the King renowned for his pious Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which God afterward bleſſed with a happy death. A fault then he did, none can doubt of it; yet like a vertuous Prince ſubmitted to any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nay, ſought for more then was inflicted. But, I know not how, our Doctor hath a rare gift to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate a puniſhment, if the <hi>Pope</hi> hath a hand in it, and to ſay nothing of the fault: No. That muſt be concealed. So it is; The child is corrected by an indulgent Father, and complains of his whipping, but never tells you why he felt the Rod, or what he did amiſs. Had the Doctor dealt ingenuouſly; he
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107258:108"/> ſhould (where he ends with this ſcornful <hi>Ironia) Such was the piety of the Fathers in Chriſtendom,</hi> firſt have ſaid. Such were the ſins of Princes, and laid out as well the faults, as the puniſhment. Beſides, ſuppoſe (which yet is not proved) that a few, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many <hi>Popes,</hi> did amiſs, or tranſgreſſed by too much ſeverity; muſt therefore Popedom be decryed, and all <hi>Popes</hi> made odious? An open injuſtice it is, good Doctor to revile all, whether <hi>Popes</hi> or <hi>Princes,</hi> becauſe ſome only have offended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 168. He tells us of a ſtrange paradox that <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. vented in the Council of <hi>Vienna, making the right of Kings dependant on him</hi> (which is an untruth, their Temporal rights depend not on him) and the Doctor for this Aſſertion of <hi>Clement,</hi> cites not one Authour. <hi>Page</hi> 169. He talks of <hi>Pope Boniface the</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.; <hi>owning himſelf not only Lord of France, but of all the World.</hi> And who affirms this? <hi>Papirius Maſſonus,</hi> ſaith the Doctor: And cites in his Margent, <hi>Verb. Bonif.</hi> 8. Anſw. This blind and unſkilful way in quoting of Authours (held all along by our Doctor) is more then intollerable. Know, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, that <hi>Maſsonus</hi> writ 4. Books of Annals, wherein he deſcribes the Exploits of <hi>Frenchmen;</hi> I have his 2. Edition, <hi>Paris print.</hi> 1578. Should not the Doctor think you (had he ever ſeen theſe Annalls) have pointed to ſome one of theſe 4. <hi>Books?</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving us in darkneſs, with only the word <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> 8. which is no Title, but only found in the Index. However to unbeguile the Reader, by help of the Index, I have peruſed what <hi>Maſſonus</hi> hath of <hi>Pope Boniface, lib 3. pag.</hi> 337. he deſcribes his manners, and ſays, <hi>He was Learned, but withal crafty,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107258:109"/> Not a ſyllable there of <hi>Boniface His owning himſelf Lord of</hi> France, <hi>or the World. lib. 3. pag.</hi> 351. He tells us, <hi>That after</hi> Philip le Bell <hi>had oppreſſed the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, with heavy Taxes, to maintain a War againſt</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>the Pope diſliked it, and therefore forbad the abuſe; Withal, willed</hi> Philip <hi>not to oppreſs Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with ſuch Exactions.</hi> The King obeyed not; <hi>Whereupon,</hi> ſaith Maſſon, <hi>Boniface ſent him a ſharp Letter,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>that all Kings were ſubject to the Pope and Church, (underſtand in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs,</hi> for the whole Context bears no other Sence) <hi>and that he had offended againſt both</hi> Equity <hi>and</hi> Order of Law, <hi>by ſeizing on the Clergies Goods, conferring Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Dignities,</hi> &amp;c. What is here, good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Boniface owning</hi> himſelf Lord of <hi>France,</hi> and the whole World alſo? When neither <hi>France</hi> nor the World, are not ſo much as mentioned; Nor any word found relating to the Temporal Juriſdiction of Princes.</p>
            <p>The Doctor ſaith more: <hi>That all the Jeſuites Order makes the Pope Lord of the World, and that the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of it is the Subject matter of their new Vow of Obedience, to advance his Grandeur.</hi> Anſw. Few Jeſuites will read this vaſt laſhing out of all Reaſon, without ſmiling a little at the Doctor, and may, moſt juſtly <hi>Vow,</hi> that he is yet to learn, what both their Doctrine, and Inſtitution is. I ſay therefore, his Aſſertions are utterly untrue. The Order of Jeſuites never made the Pope Lord of the World; never thought it; never taught it; (ſee <hi>Bellarmin</hi> cited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove:) and their 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
               <hi>Vow of Obedience</hi> No more advances his temporal Grandeur, then the Doctors talk hurts his Spiritual juriſdiction, that is, juſt nothing at all. What he next cites out of ſome <hi>Canoniſts,</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:107258:109"/> is neither the Doctrine of the Church, nor good Divinity.</p>

               </hi> &amp;c. <hi>There is no ſuch Oration of Sixtus extant here; and, that which is publiſhed by Enemies, although it deſerves no credit, may yet have a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Explication, as is farther read in our anſwer pag.</hi> 70, 71, 72. What is this but to ſay in plain Engliſh that the Oration is <hi>Spurious,</hi> and though it were as bad as ſome Adverſaries make it, yet it may be without difficulty Explicated.</p>
            <p>Our Doctor, page 171. having done with his <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive, ends, with an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Exhortation to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade and Exhort all, as they deſire to be ſaved, in the day of the Lord Jeſus, to decline from theſe horrid Doctrines.</hi> (thoſe he means which he charges on us) And ſo do I good Reader alſo, without half the ſtirr the Doctor has made about them; for they are all Monſters, of his own making. Horrid it is, and Monſtrous to Aſſert, as he doth; <hi>That we are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Monarchy, that we profeſs not a due Obedience to Princes, that the whole Order of Jeſuites owns the</hi> Pope <hi>Lord of the World,</hi> &amp;c. Ignorance begot theſe Doctrines; Fancy miſhaped them in ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Brain; Paſſion brought them forth; out they are as you ſee in print, ugly, and ill-favoured; We utterly diſ-own them, and ſay they are falſe. The naked Truth I have declared, and therefore <hi>exhort all, that love Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ro decline from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors horrid miſtakes. After the reſt of his wordy <hi>paraeneſis</hi> (not worth taking notice of) for a <hi>farwel,</hi> he cloſes up all with a <hi>Behold, we ſet before you Life and Death, Bleſſing and Curſing, Safety and Danger,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer. He hath done ſo indeed; but the danger (God knows) lies where he leaſt thinks, in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107258:110"/> his own unpardonable Errors, miſ-leading ſimple Souls to Perdition: God prevent that he does not too late bewail his inconſiderate venting of them; I need not preach to the Doctor, he believes I hope already, that Death (and that Eternal) will be the miſerable portion of all thoſe Seducers who do not timely repent, and make themſelves Members of the Catholick Church: God give the Doctor grace to conſider of this ſeriouſly and ſuddenly; Into this Houſe of God (as I have heard) he was once ready to enter; but neglecting the Grace that call'd him, he is now as you ſee, ſo unfortunate as to diſwade others from entering alſo; With what ſting of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience he hath done this evil, God only knows; done it is, and I ſuſpect the worſt. But the great Day of our Lord Jeſus, when both he and I muſt be heard to juſtifie our ſelves, without <hi>farther diſpute,</hi> will lay open, Whether, he hath wrong'd his Conſcience in writing this <hi>Diſſuaſive,</hi> or, I without cauſe have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him of Errors. To this Impartial Judge, and moſt juſt Tribunal, I appeal for Sentence: And ſhall in the <hi>Interim,</hi> earneſtly pray, as behoves a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and friendly Adverſary, for Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Converſion.</p>
